<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE RESCUE OF PHILIP</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Meg!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl curled up in the window-seat
did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg, you know Mother said we were to go
before four o&#8217;clock, and it&#8217;s half-past three now.
You&#8217;ll wait till the twins come in, and then
they&#8217;ll want to go, too.&#8221; Bobby Blossom looked
anxiously at his sister.</p>
<p>Meg put down her book and untangled her
feet from the window cushions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; she promised. &#8220;I never do get
a chapter all read, Bobby. Where&#8217;s my hat? I
see it. I&#8217;ll get it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg&#8217;s hat was on the lawn outside where she
had dropped it, and now she raised the screen
and tumbled through the window to the ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
It wasn&#8217;t far to tumble, and Meg had done it so
often she was sure of landing safely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Norah says no lady goes out of the house
through a window,&#8221; giggled Bobby, tumbling
after Meg and closing the screen carefully.
Bobby was always careful to leave everything
as he found it.</p>
<p>Meg giggled, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, long as I grow up to be a lady
like Mother,&#8221; she asserted. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry, Bobby,
and perhaps we can stop at the library.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children had reached the two stone posts
at the foot of the lawn when a loud shriek halted
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg Blossom, you said I could go! Wait for
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the slightly sloping lawn hurried a
short, thick-set little girl with dark eyes and hair
and the reddest cheeks you ever saw. She carried
a doll whose blue eyes opened and shut
snappily with every jump her small mother took.
This was Dot, Meg&#8217;s little sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said I could go,&#8221; panted Dot, when she
caught up with Meg and Bobby. &#8220;Wait for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
Twaddles, he&#8217;s coming. He wants to take the
kiddie car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you so,&#8221; scolded Bobby. &#8220;I never went
uptown in my life all you children didn&#8217;t want to
tag along. You&#8217;ve got grease on your dress,
Dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam was cleaning the car,&#8221; said Dot serenely.
&#8220;I guess I brushed against the grease can. It
won&#8217;t show when I&#8217;m sitting down. There&#8217;s
Twaddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bumping its way over the green grass came a
kiddie car with a small boy astride it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all ready,&#8221; he beamed. &#8220;Come on,
Bobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t take that kiddie car,&#8221; announced
Bobby firmly. &#8220;Mother said this letter was to
go in the four o&#8217;clock mail and we&#8217;ve got to
hurry. If you and Dot want to go, you&#8217;ll have
to walk fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles usually minded Bobby. He
promptly surrendered the kiddie car and continued
to smile pleasantly.</p>
<p>The four Blossoms trudged briskly along. If
you had ever lived in Oak Hill you would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
known them. The whole town knew Meg and
Bobby and Dot and Twaddles, and the children
knew nearly every one, having lived in that one
place all their short lives.</p>
<p>Bobby was the oldest. He was seven, and was
remarkably like his sister Meg in looks. Both
had fair hair and blue eyes. Meg&#8217;s real name
was Margaret Alice Blossom, and she was named
for her mother. Bobby&#8217;s full name was Robert
Hayward Blossom. He was just a year older
than Meg.</p>
<p>The twins were the funniest and dearest little
couple, four years old and as roly-poly, happy-go-lucky
a pair of youngsters as ever tumbled
into one scrape after another and out again.
They were known as Dot and Twaddles to all
their friends, but, of course, they had &#8220;real&#8221;
names like other children. Dot was named for
an aunt, Dorothy Anna Blossom, and Twaddles
was Arthur Gifford Blossom, if you please.
Only no one ever called him that.</p>
<p>The Blossom children lived at the very tip
end of the long straggling street that divided
Oak Hill into two sections; in fact the Blossoms&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
rambling, comfortable old house was almost outside
the town limits. Father Blossom owned
the big foundry on the other side of the railroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go in,&#8221; said Bobby, when they reached
the post-office. &#8220;You wait here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He disappeared into the yellow wooden building
that was the Oak Hill post-office, and the
other Blossoms, seeing a stalled car, stopped
to watch the troubles of the interurban motorman
whose trolley-car was blocked by a dog
that apparently wanted to be run over.</p>
<p>The motorman clanged his bell and a boy on
the curbstone whistled shrilly, but the dog refused
to budge. He only rolled over on his
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hurt,&#8221; said Meg. &#8220;See, his foot drags.
I&#8217;ll get him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dashed out into the street and bent over
the poor animal. Meg was &#8220;just crazy,&#8221; her
brothers said, about animals, and she was never
afraid of any four-footed creature. Now, as
she leaned over the little dog, he began to lick
her hand with his rough tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;His leg&#8217;s broken,&#8221; Meg said pityingly to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
conductor and the motorman who had joined
her. &#8220;Oh, the poor doggie! But Doctor Maynard
will fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a crowd now gathered on the car
tracks, and Bobby, who had come out of the
post-office and heard from the twins what was
going on, pushed his way through to his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hold your dress,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
lift him. There!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little dog was a heavy armful for Meg,
but she held him bravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of strange dogs myself,&#8221; declared
the conductor, plainly relieved that some one
else had tended to the dog. &#8220;What are you
going to do with him, little girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him to the doctor&#8217;s,&#8221; announced Meg.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; affirmed Bobby.</p>
<p>He and Meg, carrying the dog, went back to
where Twaddles and Dot were waiting. The
twins were used to waiting patiently while the
older children investigated sudden alarms and
excitements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me pat him,&#8221; begged Dot. &#8220;He&#8217;s pretty,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
isn&#8217;t he? Is he hurt, Meg? What are you
going to do with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him to Doctor Maynard&#8217;s,&#8221; said Meg
briefly. &#8220;I guess he&#8217;s in, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s after four
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kind, jolly Doctor Maynard was in. He was
the Blossoms&#8217; family doctor, and knew the children
very well. He didn&#8217;t seem a bit surprised
to have the four of them walk into his consulting
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, who&#8217;s sick?&#8221; he demanded, pretending
to be anxious. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me Dot needs gingerbread
pills? Or has Twaddles been eating too
much layer cake? Dear, dear, you can&#8217;t all
have the whooping cough!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg smiled, a little watery smile. Tears stood
in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this,&#8221; she said, spreading out her dress
on the couch so that the doctor could see the
dog. &#8220;I think his leg is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Maynard sat down on the couch and
the children crowded around him. The brown
eyes of the dog watched him intently as though
he knew that help was at hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s broken,&#8221; said the doctor gently, after
feeling of the slim little hind leg that dragged
so uselessly. &#8220;But we can mend it, Meg. I
have splints right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the others watched, Doctor Maynard
tore off long white strips of cloth and selected
two wooden splints. These he placed one on
each side of the broken leg and then directed
Meg to wind the strips firmly around while he
held the splints in place. This was to make the
leg grow strong and straight again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it hurt?&#8221; demanded Twaddles curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it hurts him,&#8221; admitted Doctor Maynard,
stroking the head of the little dog. &#8220;But
animals are splendid patients, and they seldom
complain. Now, then, our little friend is about
as good as new, except that he will have to go
on three legs for a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The telephone rang just then and it proved to
be a call for the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to run along, chicks,&#8221; he said hurriedly.
&#8220;Going to keep the dog, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mother doesn&#8217;t care,&#8221; answered Meg.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mother won&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Bobby, as the children
were walking home. He was very fond of
his sister and tried to help her get whatever she
wanted. &#8220;Sam will let him sleep in the garage
and perhaps he will be a ratter. Sam likes a dog
that is a ratter.&#8221; Sam Layton was the man of all
work employed by Mr. Blossom.</p>
<p>Meg and Bobby took turns carrying the dog
home, and Twaddles mourned the fact that the
kiddie car had not been brought along.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have given him a ride,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;What makes his tongue hang out like that,
Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hot,&#8221; said Meg. &#8220;And I think he wants
a drink. Let&#8217;s take him around to the kitchen
and give him some water.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they neared the kitchen door some one
spoke to them through the screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg! Meg! What&#8217;s this you do be bringing
home with ye? A dog? Most likely it has
the mange now, or some disease ye will all be
catching. Why can&#8217;t ye ever take up with a
nice, quiet cat? &#8217;Tis no dog I&#8217;ll be having in me
clean kitchen, mind that!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>Meg put the strange dog down on the gravel
path. He swayed unsteadily on three legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Norah,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His leg is broken.
Doctor Maynard set it. And we only want to
get him a drink of water. He&#8217;s thirsty. He
needn&#8217;t even come into the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norah had a sharp tongue, but her heart was
generous and sweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor beastie!&#8221; she said, opening the
screen door of her jealously guarded kitchen.
&#8220;Bring him in, Meg. He do be having fever, I
suspect. I&#8217;ll get him a cup of water. Dear,
dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>Making a soft, sympathetic, clucking noise,
Norah hurried to get a cup of cool water which
the little dog lapped up greedily, standing on
his three good legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby said he thought Sam would let him
sleep in the garage,&#8221; said Meg. &#8220;I suppose it
is cooler there for him. All right, Norah, I&#8217;ll
carry him out. But we want to show him to
Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She went to meet your father&ndash;&ndash;she and Sam
with the car,&#8221; Norah told them. &#8220;And if I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
get my biscuits in, they&#8217;ll be back before there&#8217;s
a thing cooked to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children took the hint and hurried to
the garage. Bobby and Twaddles spread an
old mat for the dog in a cool, dark corner, and
very glad he seemed to be to have a place to
lie down.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll bring you some supper,&#8221; Meg promised,
patting him kindly. &#8220;You take a nap and
forget &#8217;bout your troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the car round front!&#8221; shouted Twaddles.
&#8220;Bet you I see Daddy first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet you don&#8217;t!&#8221; shrieked Dot.</p>
<p>With wild whoops the children tore round to
the front of the house and fell upon Father and
Mother Blossom just getting out of the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;We brought a dog home,&#8221; cried Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out and see him,&#8221; urged Meg, clinging
to her Mother&#8217;s hand. &#8220;He&#8217;s a dear little
dog, and I love him already.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>AN INVITATION</h3>
</div>
<p>The Blossoms all went back to the garage
and found Sam bending over the sick dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cute little fellow, Mr. Blossom,&#8221; said
Sam. &#8220;Just a pup, too. Shouldn&#8217;t wonder if he
turned out to be a good ratter when his leg gets
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the highest praise Sam could give
a dog, and Meg and Bobby were delighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;May we keep him, Mother?&#8221; they urged.
&#8220;He can live in the garage. Please, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom looked at Father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ralph?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, keep him, of course,&#8221; counseled Father
Blossom, laughter-twinkles in his kind eyes.
&#8220;Norah is the sole objector in the family, and if
you can pacify her there&#8217;s no reason why we
shouldn&#8217;t have as many dogs as we want. Named
him yet, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to think about a name for him,&#8221; replied
Meg. &#8220;You can&#8217;t change names, you know,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
and I wouldn&#8217;t want him to have a silly name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my cautious daughter,&#8221; said Father
Blossom. &#8220;And now it seems to me that some
one said we were going to have supper early to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; declared Mother Blossom. &#8220;Children,
you have several things to do before you
are ready for the table. Your faces and hands
are a sight. Bobby, didn&#8217;t you go to the post-office?
Was there any mail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot, Mother&ndash;&ndash;there was one letter for
you,&#8221; answered Bobby, pulling a crumpled envelope
from his pocket. &#8220;The dog kind of took
my attention,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Mother Blossom went into the house to read
her letter, and the four children scampered upstairs
to wash their faces and hands. Meg and
Dot shared the same room, and Bobby and
Twaddles slept in the room adjoining. Each
child had a little white bed and a separate bureau.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d better put on another dress,&#8221; said
Dot doubtfully. &#8220;Mother didn&#8217;t say to, though.
Shall I, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I would,&#8221; advised Meg. &#8220;Not a
spandy clean one, &#8217;cause you mussed up two yesterday.
Put on the green one again, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tore that,&#8221; objected Dot, who certainly had
bad luck with her clothes. &#8220;Oh, dear, I don&#8217;t
see why I wasn&#8217;t a bird with a dress all glued
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Most ready?&#8221; asked Mother Blossom, who
had come upstairs while the little girls were
talking. &#8220;Let Mother tie your ribbon, Meg.
What&#8217;s the matter with Dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg bubbled into a gay little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was wishing she was a bird with a dress
glued on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it would,&#8221; agreed Mother Blossom.
&#8220;But bring me the white piqu&eacute;, dear, and let me
help you into it. Daddy is waiting for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot was buttoned into a clean dress in a
minute, and then Mother Blossom had to call
Twaddles away from the basin in the bathroom
where he was playing in the water instead of
washing his hands, and she had to find a clean
handkerchief for Bobby, and then, at last, they
could all go downstairs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>Father Blossom was playing the mechanical
piano, but he stopped as soon as he saw them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody here to-night?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Well,
that is fine! Come on, Dottie-mine, and Daddy
will tie your bib for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins did not always have supper with
Mother and Father Blossom. Sometimes they
had their bread and milk at five o&#8217;clock and went
to bed at half-past six. It was a treat for them
to eat supper with their father.</p>
<p>Mother Blossom smiled at the eager faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve company coming,&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;Some one you love to have visit us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When are they coming?&#8221; asked Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; answered Mother Blossom. &#8220;If
I hadn&#8217;t asked Bobby for the mail, we might
have been in a great pickle. She&#8217;s coming on
the nine-fifty-six to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Polly!&#8221; shouted the four little Blossoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it Aunt Polly, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will she stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we go to meet her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will she bring a trunk?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>Mother Blossom put her hands over her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t all talk at once,&#8221; she begged. &#8220;Yes,
Aunt Polly is coming. She can&#8217;t stay long, not
even a week&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do you think?&#8221; interrupted Father
Blossom. &#8220;She wants the four Blossoms to go
home with her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, you&#8217;re not a bit better than Bobby,&#8221;
scolded Mother Blossom. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to
tell them to-night. However, there&#8217;s no use trying
to keep a secret in this family. Aunt Polly
has invited you all to spend the summer at
Brookside Farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, of course, the children could talk of
nothing else after that. Aunt Polly Hayward
was Mother Blossom&#8217;s eldest sister. She was a
widow and lived on a fine farm many miles distant
from the town of Oak Hill. She came often
to visit Mother Blossom, and the children
thought there was no one like her. To go to see
Aunt Polly was a wonderful treat, and even
Bobby, who, as the oldest of the four little Blossoms,
had had more experiences than the others,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
had never been away from home in his life to
stay.</p>
<p>They were all up early the next morning, and
Sam and the car took Father Blossom to the
foundry immediately after breakfast so as to be
back in time to meet Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Polly&#8217;s coming, Norah,&#8221; said Meg, happily,
as Norah was clearing the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, and I&#8217;ve heard nothing else since last
night,&#8221; rejoined Norah. &#8220;How is the dog, your
poor patient, this bright morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby and Twaddles and Dot looked at each
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog?&#8221; repeated Bobby. &#8220;My goodness,
we forgot him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t forget him,&#8221; Meg said. &#8220;At least,
I remembered him after I was in bed. I came
down to feed him, and Daddy heard me and
wouldn&#8217;t let me go out in my nightgown. He
took him some bread and milk. And this morning
I fed him before breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s he feel?&#8221; asked Twaddles sympathetically.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s ever so much better,&#8221; Meg informed
him. &#8220;He can wag his leg some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His tail, you mean,&#8221; corrected Bobby. &#8220;Dogs
don&#8217;t wag their legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They do, too,&#8221; argued Meg. &#8220;Anyway this
one does, so that shows he is better. And I&#8217;ve
thought up a name for him. I&#8217;m going to call
him Philip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to call him that for?&#8221; he
said curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read it in a book,&#8221; answered Meg. &#8220;He
looks as if he ought to be named Philip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby was too surprised to argue, and just
then Mother Blossom called to them that Sam
was coming back with the car and they hurried
out to see who could go to the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Polly will like to see us,&#8221; declared Dot
confidently. &#8220;And this dress is just as clean,
Mother. There&#8217;s only a tiny speck of egg on
a tuck&ndash;&ndash;it doesn&#8217;t show a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom sat down on the top step and
pulled Dot into her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a duck of a clean frock,&#8221; she assured her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
small daughter, kissing her. &#8220;And do you know
there&#8217;s just one way to avoid disappointment, and
we&#8217;ll take it; we&#8217;ll all go to meet Aunt Polly.
If she has any bundles, she&#8217;ll just have to leave
them, or Sam can tie them on behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam grinned.</p>
<p>When they reached the station Mother Blossom
announced that the children were to stay
quietly in the car while she went around to the
front platform to meet Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose she&#8217;ll bring us anything?&#8221;
asked Twaddles hopefully, as Mother Blossom
disappeared around the corner of the ticket
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t polite,&#8221; reproved Meg quickly.
&#8220;You must be glad to see company whether they
bring you things or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There she is!&#8221; Dot stood up in the car and
pointed. &#8220;Aunt Polly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Polly!&#8221; shouted the three other little
Blossoms loudly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AUNT POLLY</h3>
</div>
<p>Aunt Polly was short and stout with
merry blue eyes and curly dark hair that,
where it showed under her pretty hat brim, was
just touched with gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Blessings!&#8221; she greeted the children,
as they spilled out of the car to meet her.
&#8220;Every one of you here? That&#8217;s fine. How do
you do, Sam? I&#8217;ve two bags there on the platform,
if you will get them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they were all stowed away in the car,
Sam put the bags in the front where he and
Bobby sat, and backed the car out of the station
driveway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, have you decided to come home with
me?&#8221; Aunt Polly put the question to them
bluntly.</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms glanced uncertainly
at each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly Hayward,&#8221; said Mother Blossom
gayly, &#8220;you know perfectly well no one could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
get four children ready to take a journey in three
days. Why, Dot has absolutely nothing to
wear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll lend her something,&#8221; smiled Aunt
Polly.</p>
<p>The children laughed at the idea of Auntie
lending any dress of hers to small Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll fix it somehow,&#8221; declared Aunt Polly
comfortably. &#8220;I simply have to have those
youngsters for a visit at Brookside. We&#8217;re all
getting so fat and lazy with no one to stir us up.
Even the dog and cat need rousing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a dog, Aunt Polly,&#8221; announced
Meg, her eyes shining. &#8220;His name is Philip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before she had a chance to describe Philip
the car reached the Blossom house and stopped
at the side door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am again, Norah,&#8221; said Aunt Polly,
as Norah came out to receive her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And &#8217;tis glad I am to see ye, Mrs. Hayward,&#8221;
responded Norah heartily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
the bags, Sam. The guest room&#8217;s all ready,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four children went as far as the guest-room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
door with Aunt Polly, and then Mother
Blossom waved them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Auntie and I have a great deal to talk over,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You run away and amuse yourselves
till lunch time, like good little Blossoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I give them what I&#8217;ve brought
them,&#8221; hastily interposed Aunt Polly. &#8220;Bobby,
you open that black bag and the four parcels
on top are for you children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby opened the bag and took out four packages
neatly wrapped in paper and tied with
cord.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;ll we know which is which?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for you to find out,&#8221; returned his aunt,
giving him a kiss.</p>
<p>Mother Blossom sat down on the bed and
began talking in a low tone to Aunt Polly and
the four children raced downstairs and out to
the garage to open their presents. They liked
the garage because there was plenty of space to
play in, where, indeed, they had four empty
rooms above the first floor for their own uses.</p>
<p>This morning they rushed upstairs so fast that
they never thought of Philip till, as they reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
the top step, Meg looked back and saw the little
dog painfully hobbling after them on his three
good legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to come, too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Here,
Philip, come on up, good doggie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philip managed to finish his climb and then
lay down on the floor, panting, but satisfied to be
where his friends were.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give each one a package,&#8221; Bobby decided.
&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll open them, one at a time, like
Christmas. You first, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg ripped the string off her parcel with a
single motion and pulled off the paper in such
a hurry that she tore it in two. Meg always hurried
to solve mysteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a game!&#8221; she cried, when she had
opened the box. &#8220;All in pieces. Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby took a look and shrieked with delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an airplane,&#8221; he announced instantly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s mine, &#8217;cause Aunt Polly knows I like
experiments. What you got, Dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot hastily unwrapped her package and discovered
a doll&#8217;s trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;With clothes in it for Geraldine,&#8221; she reported,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
after turning the tiny key and taking a
peep inside. &#8220;That&#8217;s mine all right. What&#8217;s
Twaddles got?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles unwrapped his parcel slowly and
importantly. He was sure it was for him, and he
rather enjoyed making the others wait.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but a book,&#8221; he said disgustedly.
&#8220;What kind of a book is it, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for Meg,&#8221; Bobby informed him.
&#8220;&#8216;Black Beauty.&#8217; Aunt Polly knows Meg likes
to read and is always fussing with animals. I
must have your present, Twaddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four Blossoms were more interested in
Twaddles&#8217; gift than in their own because it was
the only one they had not seen. Bobby carefully
untied the string and wound it up in a neat ring;
then he slowly took off the paper and folded
that; finally he opened the flat box.</p>
<p>Twaddles promptly tried to stand on his head,
a habit he had when he was pleased. He never
did succeed in standing on his head, but he usually
turned a very good somersault. He did
now.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me,&#8221; he shouted, bobbing right side
up again. &#8220;See, Dot, it&#8217;s a water pistol!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good thing to
give you,&#8221; pronounced Meg decisively. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
be hitting Dot in the eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t, neither,&#8221; retorted Twaddles, feeling
unjustly accused. &#8220;Aunt Polly asked me what I
wanted most last time she was here and I told
her; and she said if I&#8217;d promise not to shoot at
people, she&#8217;d get me one. So there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby, the peace-maker, proposed that they
all go in and show their presents to Norah, and
he helped Meg carry Philip downstairs because
she was sure the trip would hurt his leg. Bobby
was never in too much of a hurry to do what
Meg wanted him to do.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, after lunch, all the Blossoms
went for a long ride in the car, stopping at the
foundry office on the way home to pick up Father
Blossom. Still nothing was said about the children
going home with Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose Mother will let us?&#8221; asked
Dot, as Meg was helping her undress that night.
&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;s afraid I will use up my clean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
dresses too fast, and Aunt Polly won&#8217;t have any
to put on me. But you could lend me yours,
Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the reason,&#8221; said
Meg slowly. &#8220;I tell you what I think&ndash;&ndash;I think
Mother and Daddy have to plan a lot before they
know whether we can go. But you ought to be
more careful with your dresses, Dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Mother Blossom announced
that if the children would come out on the porch
she had something to tell them. There was a
general stampede from the breakfast table&ndash;&ndash;Father
Blossom had had an early breakfast and
had gone before the others were down&ndash;&ndash;and
Aunt Polly in the swing and Mother Blossom in
a huge rocking-chair were nearly smothered in
a shower of kisses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to Brookside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going home with Aunt Polly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I learn to milk a cow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have chickens, Aunt Polly?&#8221;
Four little voices chorused at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, dear,&#8221; chuckled Aunt Polly. &#8220;So
you&#8217;ve been thinking about Brookside all this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
time, have you? And what makes you think
your mother wants to talk about the farm with
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Four pairs of eyes fixed their anxious gaze
upon Mother Blossom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dearies,&#8221; said Mother Blossom in answer,
&#8220;Daddy and Aunt Polly and I have talked
this over, and we&#8217;ve come to a decision. It is
impossible for me to get you ready to go home
with Aunt Polly to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221; mourned Twaddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you want to go and leave Mother?&#8221;
that dear lady asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not&ndash;&ndash;not exactly,&#8221; stammered the little boy.
&#8220;But I want to go somewhere awfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you go, too, Muddie?&#8221; suggested
Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, and I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ve planned,&#8221;
said Mother Blossom. &#8220;Aunt Polly has to go
back to-morrow. We&#8217;ve tried to persuade her
to stay, but it seems the summer is a very bad
time to be away from a farm. But a week from
to-morrow, if you are all very good and help me
as much as you can, I will take you to Brookside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
to visit Aunt Polly for a month, or as long as
she can stand four active youngsters in her quiet
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted the four little Blossoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t that be great! Let&#8217;s get the trunk
down right away, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t, not till Daddy comes
home,&#8221; said Aunt Polly, fanning herself and
smiling. &#8220;A week is plenty of time, and I hear
that Dot has to have some new frocks made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Daddy coming?&#8221; Bobby asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted him to, for I think he needs a rest,&#8221;
said Aunt Polly soberly. &#8220;But the most we could
get him to promise was that he might come up
with your mother when it is time for you to go
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s going&ndash;&ndash;she said so,&#8221; Meg reminded
her aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to take you to Brookside, Daughter,&#8221;
explained Mother Blossom. &#8220;Then I am coming
home again to stay with Daddy. You see, I
couldn&#8217;t leave him alone in this house for a
whole month. Think how lonesome he would
be.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>Twaddles thought this over for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it will be a change for him,
&#8217;thout any children,&#8221; he remarked, with a sunny
smile.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly scooped him into her lap and gave
him a big hug.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now where in the world did you get that
idea?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it,&#8221; confided Twaddles cheerfully.</p>
<p>Dot had already disappeared. She thought it
time to begin her packing. Presently they heard
her in the house tumbling books out of the bookcase
on to the polished floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be, whatever are ye doing?&#8221; came
Norah&#8217;s cry. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I enough to be doing,
without ye upsetting a room as fast as I put it
in order?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE WILLING PACKERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Meg rushed into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot Blossom, you&#8217;re not to touch
my books,&#8221; she scolded. &#8220;The idea! Why
don&#8217;t you fuss with your own things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot looked vexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m helping you,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you want to take your books to Aunt Polly&#8217;s to
read rainy days? Well, then, I&#8217;ll pack &#8217;em for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom had followed Meg, and now
she intervened.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one is to pack anything to-day,&#8221; she
said firmly. &#8220;I want Dot to go into town with
a message for Miss Florence. And Meg must
practice on the piano half an hour at least. This
afternoon we&#8217;re going to take Aunt Polly driving.
After she goes home there will be plenty
for all of us to do to get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Florence Davis was the dressmaker who
often came to the house to make clothes for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Blossom children, and Dot set off presently for
her house, carrying a note to her. Miss Florence
had no telephone. She said she wasn&#8217;t home long
enough to answer it. But she always left a slip
of paper pinned to her door to tell people at
whose house she was sewing, and her customers
were used to going about the town till they
found her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says she can come,&#8221; reported Dot when
she returned from her errand. &#8220;She can give
you four days, Mother. Where are the boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom looked at her small daughter
and sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you knew Sam painted the fence
last night,&#8221; she said mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, but I forgot,&#8221; explained Dot, trying
to fold over a pleat so that the vivid streaks of
green paint would not show. &#8220;I guess I kind
of brushed up against it, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Usually when Aunt Polly went home the four
little Blossoms were disconsolate, but the next
morning they saw her to the station quite cheerfully.
Were they not going to Brookside themselves
exactly one week from that day?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now we must fly around and get ready,&#8221; announced
Bobby, when they returned to the house.
Bobby had a great trick of remembering speeches
he had heard older folk make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed then and you must,&#8221; agreed Norah,
who was sweeping the porch. &#8220;Your mother
wants Dot in the sewing room. Miss Florence
is ready to try on. And, Bobby, it&#8217;s sorry I am,
but we&#8217;re out of soap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was rather a long walk to the grocery store,
and Bobby didn&#8217;t think that going for soap
promised one bit of excitement. Neither did
Meg want to practice the piano scales that one
day were to make her a good musician. Norah
knew something of what they were thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll both be helping your mother to get
ready to go,&#8221; she said earnestly and kindly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got extra washing to do, for all your clothes
must be clean. And if Meg&#8217;s going to stop
learning music every time a new plan comes up,
she&#8217;ll grow up to be terrible ignorant of lots of
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;m going,&#8221; said Bobby quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ll be through by the time I get back,
Meg. Then I guess we can pack the toys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles, left alone, wandered up to the sewing
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Twaddles,&#8221; said Miss Florence pleasantly.
&#8220;Have you come up to see what pretty
dresses Dot is going to have? And what is this
I hear about every one going to Brookside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see Aunt Polly,&#8221; explained
Twaddles. &#8220;And, Mother, can we take toys?
Bobby&#8217;s all ready to pack &#8217;em as soon as he gets
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t pack something pretty soon, the
house won&#8217;t hold you,&#8221; observed Mother Blossom,
smiling. &#8220;You see, Twaddles dear, Mother
doesn&#8217;t believe you will need many toys at Brookside.
There will be so many wonderful new
out-of-door things for you to play with. Suppose
we say that each of you may choose the
two things you are fondest of. That won&#8217;t make
so much to carry.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that was settled, and when Bobby came
back from town and Meg had finished practicing
scales and Dot&#8217;s three new dresses had all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
been tried on, the children went upstairs to their
playroom to select the toys they thought they
would want to take with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we ought to take the things Aunt
Polly gave us,&#8221; announced Meg. &#8220;They&#8217;re new,
and we haven&#8217;t played with them much. She
might think we didn&#8217;t like &#8217;em if we left them at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, we will,&#8221; decided Bobby. &#8220;And
I&#8217;ll take my ball and bat. Guess I won&#8217;t break
Aunt Polly&#8217;s windows. There must be lots of
room on a farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take the paper dolls,&#8221; said Meg.
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure Aunt Polly will have books to
read, so that&#8217;s all right. What you going to take,
Dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Geraldine and Tottie-Fay and the trunk,&#8221;
was the prompt response.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s three,&#8221; Meg reminded her. &#8220;Mother
said we could each have two. I tell you&ndash;&ndash;you
don&#8217;t need the trunk; just take Geraldine&#8217;s new
clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; acquiesced Dot briefly.</p>
<p>Tottie-Fay was an old dollie, but dearly loved,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
and, as Father Blossom said when he heard that
she was going to Brookside, no one could need
a change of air more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to carry my kiddie-car,&#8221; declared
Twaddles serenely.</p>
<p>The others protested that the kiddie-car
wouldn&#8217;t go in the trunk; that there would be
no pavement on which to ride it; that Twaddles
should take a smaller toy.</p>
<p>Twaddles listened politely and set his obstinate
little chin firmly. He meant to take the
kiddie-car.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll express it,&#8221; said Father Blossom kindly
that night. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to send a porch swing
up and a&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh, my goodness, I almost told
you. And it is a <i>surprise</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried the four little Blossoms
eagerly. &#8220;Tell us, Daddy! Ah, do! Please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be a surprise for Aunt Polly,&#8221; suggested
Meg artfully. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us,
Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I like surprises that are surprises,&#8221; asserted
Father Blossom. &#8220;Now, not another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
word does any one get out of me on this subject.
Not a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next few days were very busy ones; but
at last two trunks were brought down and
placed in the hall, and Mother Blossom made
lists and packed and explained her plans to Meg
and Bobby, who, as the oldest, could be expected
to remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the stockings are here, dear, right in this
tray,&#8221; Mother Blossom would say. &#8220;And I&#8217;m
putting Bobby&#8217;s blouses in this trunk. You are
sure you will remember so that Aunt Polly
needn&#8217;t be bothered in case I don&#8217;t get both
trunks unpacked for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was sure she could remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Twaddles?&#8221; asked Mother Blossom
the last afternoon, when she was putting in the
very final things. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him since
lunch time. Dot, do you know where he went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s watching Sam give Philip a
bath,&#8221; volunteered Bobby. &#8220;He likes the smell
of that dog soap, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I do,&#8221; said Mother Blossom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
frankly. &#8220;It is strongly carbolic. Go and call
him in, will you, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby found Twaddles blissfully watching the
shivering Philip enduring a last rinsing after
his bath. Sam liked to keep him clean, and he
said that because a dog had a broken leg was
no reason why he shouldn&#8217;t be washed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother says for you to come in,&#8221; Bobby told
his brother. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to get ready for supper.
Gee, that soap does smell, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it,&#8221; Twaddles affirmed, sniffing luxuriously.
&#8220;I wish we took baths with that kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom sent him to the bathroom to
wash his face and hands and she brushed his
hair for him herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that I keep smelling?&#8221; she asked once
or twice, &#8220;Oh, the carbolic dog-soap. Twaddles,
I do wish you wouldn&#8217;t handle it so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been to the drug store?&#8221; said Father
Blossom, when they sat down to supper.
&#8220;Phew! I smell carbolic, strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Philip had a bath,&#8221; explained Twaddles uneasily.
&#8220;Perhaps you smell it, Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Twaddles means the soap,&#8221; giggled Meg.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t smell a bath, silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Blossom laid down his carving knife
and fork.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand that,&#8221; he declared positively.
&#8220;Twaddles, you needn&#8217;t tell me just handling a
soapy dog is responsible for the whiffs of carbolic
I&#8217;m getting. What is that in your pocket?&#8221;</p>
<p>A dark wet stain was slowly spreading in the
square little pocket of the blouse Twaddles
wore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I saved a piece,&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I
thought Spotty, Aunt Polly&#8217;s dog, ought to have
some. It&#8217;s awful healthy for dogs, Daddy. Sam
says so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Blossom had to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;But that&#8217;s
no reason why we should have to smell it. Wrap
it up and put it away if you like for Spotty. And
then come back and we&#8217;ll see if we can finish
supper in peace.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>DOT&#8217;S ADVENTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Daddy! Good-by, Daddy
dear! Good-by, dear, darling Daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms all tried to hug their
father at once. They were at the station, where
Sam and the car had brought them, and the train
that was to take them on the first lap of the journey
to Aunt Polly&#8217;s farm was turning the curve
down the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good,&#8221; said Father Blossom, speaking as
clearly as he could with Dot hanging around his
neck and Twaddles pounding his chest affectionately.
&#8220;Help Mother all you can, and be sure
to write me nice letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The long, shiny train glided into the station,
and there was a scramble among the people
waiting on the platform. Apparently every one
wanted to be the first to get on. It took Mother
and Father Blossom and Sam and the jolly conductor
to see that all four of the little Blossoms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
and the two bags were stowed away comfortably
in two seats.</p>
<p>Then Father Blossom and Sam got off and
stood on the platform talking through the open
window until the train began to move slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by!&#8221; shouted the children. &#8220;Good-by,
Daddy! Good-by, Sam!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg leaned over Twaddles, who was seated
next to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to feed Philip,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Sam waved his hand to show that he heard
and understood, and the train went faster and
faster. In a few minutes Oak Hill station was
far behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re started,&#8221; announced Bobby, with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did my kiddie-car get on?&#8221; asked Twaddles
anxiously. &#8220;S&#8217;posing they forgot it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that why you were hanging round the baggage-room?&#8221;
demanded Bobby. &#8220;Course the
kiddie-car is on. I saw Mr. Hayes putting it
on. You ask the conductor.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the conductor, who came through presently
for tickets, didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what you do,&#8221; he said, his eyes
twinkling at Twaddles. &#8220;You ask the brakesman
to take you into the baggage car and let you
look around. Then you can see for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is making a great deal of trouble,&#8221;
protested Mother Blossom. &#8220;You can easily
wait till we get to Brookside, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go, let him go,&#8221; advised the conductor
cheerily. &#8220;It will kind of break up the
monotony of the trip, ma&#8217;am. These little folks
are going to get pretty tired before they get to
Alawana.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Twaddles marched off importantly with the
conductor to find the young, good-natured
brakesman, and the three little Blossoms rather
wished they could go, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens when we get to Alawana,
Mother?&#8221; asked Bobby. &#8220;Do we change cars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear, we take the boat,&#8221; explained
Mother Blossom. &#8220;If the train is on time we
have an hour to wait, which will allow us to
have lunch; then we take a steamer that takes us
up Lake Tobago to Little Havre. There we take
a stage, or a wagon, or whatever they have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
meet the boat, and ride to Four Crossways; and
there Aunt Polly meets us and drives us over to
Brookside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Twaddles,&#8221; announced Dot.
&#8220;Did you find the kiddie car?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s there,&#8221; reported Twaddles, squeezing
in past Meg, and climbing into his place beside
his twin. &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of trunks and things
there, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the long stretches when the train
hummed steadily along and there was nothing
to be seen from the car windows but miles and
miles of green fields and woods with here and
there a house, the children played a game
Mother Blossom had known when she was a
little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;My ship is loaded with apples,&#8221; Bobby would
say.</p>
<p>&#8220;My ship is loaded with apricots,&#8221; Meg would
declare.</p>
<p>Dot usually had to think a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;My ship is loaded with&ndash;&ndash;with ashes,&#8221; she
might announce finally.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My ship is loaded with at;&#8221; this from
Twaddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Twaddles!&#8221; Bobby would scold. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t load a ship with &#8216;at.&#8217; That isn&#8217;t anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis, too,&#8221; maintained Twaddles stubbornly.
&#8220;It begins with &#8216;a,&#8217; doesn&#8217;t it? And it&#8217;s a word.
So there.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Twaddles had his way and was excused
from thinking up another word, it would be
Mother Blossom&#8217;s turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;My ship is loaded with asters,&#8221; she might
say, smiling.</p>
<p>When no one could think of another word that
began with A, they would go on to B. This game
amused the children for many minutes at a
time. They had just started on words beginning
with C when the train reached Alawana.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry,&#8221; declared Meg, when they all
stood together on the platform and the train that
had brought them from Oak Hill was nothing
but a black speck in the distance. &#8220;We had
breakfast an awful long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I guess it was yesterday,&#8221; said Dot mournfully.</p>
<p>Mother Blossom laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor chickens, you are hungry,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Never mind, I see a nice little restaurant across
the street. Let me find out when the boat goes,
and then we&#8217;ll have a good, hot lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lake Tobago boat, Mother Blossom
found out, left in half an hour. Their train had
been late. However, the dock was not far off,
and Mother Blossom was sure they would have
time for sandwiches and milk at least.</p>
<p>All the children were tremendously excited
at the thought of going on a steamer, as not one
of them had ever been on a boat. There was no
lake or river near Oak Hill, and the largest body
of water the four little Blossoms had seen was
the town reservoir.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they have sails, I&#8217;m going to roll &#8217;em up
and down,&#8221; Dot announced, so thrilled at the
prospect that she upset her glass of milk down
the front of her frock.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to wear it,&#8221; said Mother Blossom,
mopping her as dry as she could with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
napkin. &#8220;Perhaps I can put a dry dress on you
on the boat. Now try to eat quietly, dear; we
haven&#8217;t much time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shower-bath of milk rather subdued Dot
for the moment, and lunch was finished without
further mishap. Then a brief walk through the
pretty little country town brought them to the
lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-oh! Isn&#8217;t it lovely!&#8221; breathed Meg. &#8220;Just
see how it sparkles in the sun. Don&#8217;t you like
it, Dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; agreed Dot carelessly.</p>
<p>Her quick eyes had spied an old organ grinder
and his monkey on the other side of the dock.
She slipped under the rope, where the people
who wanted to take the boat were standing, and
ran over to the music.</p>
<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t have hurried,&#8221; said Mother Blossom,
coming back to her little folk. She had
been to the office to have the baggage checks
looked after. &#8220;The boat is held up for another
half hour because of some engine trouble.
Where&#8217;s Dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, where was Dot? Meg had thought her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
little sister was standing next to her. The boys
were sure she had been just behind them. Where
was Dot?</p>
<p>She stood in the crowd gathered about the
organ grinder, a little girl with shining dark eyes
and a milk-splashed frock, watching the clever
bowing and scraping of the small monkey with
evident delight. Then a sudden movement of
the people about her startled her. She remembered
that she was supposed to go somewhere
with the rest of her family. She saw people
hurrying toward a large automobile with nine
or ten long seats in it, and she hurried toward it,
too. A man helped her up the high step, and she
found a seat just behind the driver.</p>
<p>The automobile was lumbering up a narrow
white road with woods on either side of it before
Dot realized where she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this isn&#8217;t the boat!&#8221; she said aloud.</p>
<p>The lady seated next to her glanced at her
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boat?&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;This jitney goes
to Fermarsh. You&#8217;re not traveling all alone,
are you, little girl? You don&#8217;t look more&#8217;n five.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I was four in June,&#8221; announced Dot with
dignity. &#8220;Twaddles was, too. We&#8217;re twins. But
I have to go to Little Havre on the boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going in the opposite direction,&#8221; said
the woman placidly. She did not seem to care.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that on your dress?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot&#8217;s tears brimmed over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Milk,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;I tipped it over. An&#8217;
I have to go on the boat with my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jitney driver heard and turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You belong on the
boat, little girl? Well, now, don&#8217;t cry; we&#8217;ll
fix it. I heard they had engine trouble to-day,
and like as not they&#8217;ll be late starting. Long up
the road a spell we&#8217;ll meet the two o&#8217;clock jitney
coming back, and I&#8217;ll see that Dave Gunn takes
you in with him. An&#8217; if you do miss the boat
my wife&#8217;ll take care of you over night and we&#8217;ll
ship you up to Little Havre on to-morrow&#8217;s
boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot felt that the jitney driver was very kind,
but she hoped with all her heart that she would
not have to stay all night in a strange house. She
wanted her mother, and Twaddles and Meg and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Bobby. She hadn&#8217;t known till this minute how
dearly she loved them.</p>
<p>Sure enough, their jitney had not gone very
far when they saw another jitney coming toward
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Dave!&#8221; called the driver of Dot&#8217;s jitney.
&#8220;Got a passenger for you. A little lady who
tangled up her traveling directions and missed
getting on the boat. You take her with you, and
see that she lands on the steamer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Gunn stopped his machine and came over
to the other jitney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Sister,&#8221; he said pleasantly, lifting
Dot down gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are little to be traveling on your
own. I&#8217;ve got three home &#8217;bout your size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom, as you may suppose, had
been nearly frantic all this time. She had taken
the other children on board the boat and had left
them on deck with the bags, after they had
promised not to stir from the spot where she left
them, and she had been going up and down the
dock making inquiries, and even walking up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
into the town, believing that perhaps some of the
store windows had attracted Dot.</p>
<p>No one remembered seeing a little girl in a
green dress and a brown straw hat.</p>
<p>Just as Mother Blossom was wearily wondering
if she should telegraph Father Blossom that
Dot was lost, a motor jitney lumbered down to
the dock. Some one in a green dress and a brown
straw hat was sitting on the front seat beside the
driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother! Mother!&#8221; shouted Dot.</p>
<p>There was just time for her to tumble out of
the car into her mother&#8217;s arms, just time for
Mother Blossom to give the driver a dollar bill
and say a word of thanks, and then the steamboat
whistle blew loudly once.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means she&#8217;s starting,&#8221; said the jitney
man. &#8220;Run!&#8221;</p>
<p>And hand in hand, Mother Blossom and Dot
raced down the wharf and over the gangplank on
to the deck of the boat, just as it began to slide
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>BROOKSIDE AT LAST</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We thought you weren&#8217;t coming,&#8221; said
Meg anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find Dot?&#8221; asked Bobby and
Twaddles in the same breath.</p>
<p>Dot smiled serenely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came back myself,&#8221; she informed them.
&#8220;The jitney man told me how.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom sat down on a camp-stool and
fanned herself with Twaddles&#8217; blue sailor hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;See if we can&#8217;t get to Brookside without any
more mishaps,&#8221; she commanded the children.
&#8220;If we had missed the boat, think of the worry
and trouble for Aunt Polly. Even if we telegraphed
she wouldn&#8217;t get it before she started
over to meet us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms promised to be very
good and to stay close together.</p>
<p>Lake Tobago was a small lake, very pretty,
and for some minutes the children saw enough
on the shores they were passing to keep them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
contented and interested. In one place two little
boys and their father were out fishing in a rowboat
and the steamer passed so close to them that
the four little Blossoms, leaning over the rail,
could almost shake hands with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another wharf! Do we stop there?
Yes, we do! Come on, Dot, let&#8217;s watch!&#8221;
shouted Twaddles, as the steamer headed inshore
toward a pier built out into the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep away from the gangplank,&#8221; warned
Mother Blossom. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t get in people&#8217;s
way, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pier was something of a disappointment,
because when the boat tied up there the children
discovered that only freight was to be taken off
and more boxes carried on. There was only one
man at the wharf, and apparently no town for
miles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t anybody live here?&#8221; asked Twaddles,
almost climbing over the rail in his eagerness
to see everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! There&#8217;s a town back about half a
mile,&#8221; explained the deck-hand who was carrying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
on a crate of live chickens. &#8220;This is just
where farmers drive in with their stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see the chickens,&#8221; cried Dot, climbing
up beside her brother.</p>
<p>Her elbow knocked his hat, and because he
hadn&#8217;t the elastic under his chin, it went sailing
over on to the wharf. One of the men rolling a
barrel toward the steamer did not see the hat
and calmly rolled his barrel over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve done it!&#8221; scolded Meg, in her
big-sister anxiety. &#8220;That&#8217;s a fine-looking hat
to go to see Aunt Polly in. Hey, please, will you
bring it back here with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man with the barrel heard and turned.
He picked up the shapeless broken straw that
had been Twaddles&#8217; best new hat, and brought it
to them, grinning. Several people who had been
watching laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does look funny, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Meg.
&#8220;You&#8217;d better go and show it to Mother, Twaddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles went back to Mother Blossom and
dangled his hat before her sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Twaddles!&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Is that your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
hat? And we&#8217;re miles from a store. Here, let
me straighten out the brim. What happened
to it? Where did you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles said truthfully enough that he
hadn&#8217;t been anywhere, and explained what had
happened to the hat. The boat was out in the
lake again by this time and steaming on toward
Little Havre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the others?&#8221; asked Mother Blossom.
&#8220;Tell them we get off in fifteen or twenty
minutes, and I want them all to come and stay
near me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the boat scraped alongside a wide
wharf and a number of people began to bustle
off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going now?&#8221; asked Twaddles,
his round eyes dancing with excitement.
Twaddles certainly loved traveling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you &#8217;member?&#8221; said Meg importantly.
&#8220;We have to go to Four Crossways, and Aunt
Polly will meet us. There&#8217;s a bus that says
&#8216;Four Crossways,&#8217; Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom had to see about the trunks
and the kiddie-car, which, it seemed, were all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
to go in a queer contrivance attached to the motor
bus, a &#8220;trailer,&#8221; the driver called it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that nice?&#8221; beamed Bobby, when he
heard of this arrangement. &#8220;Our trunks will
get there the same time we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children watched this trailer being
loaded, and then all climbed into the bus and
began the journey to Four Crossways. There
were so many people on their way there that
Bobby and Twaddles had to be squeezed into
the front seat between the driver and the man
who took the fares, and they liked this immensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to Brookside,&#8221; volunteered
Twaddles, who was sociably inclined, as soon as
the driver seemed to have his engine fixed to
suit him and the car was purring up the straight,
wide road.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see Aunt Polly,&#8221; chimed in Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of you, isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; said the
driver, smiling.</p>
<p>When both boys said they had never been on
a real farm, the driver, whose name, he told
them, was Gus Rede, had so much to say about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the fun that awaited boys on a farm and especially
such a fine place as Brookside that before
Bobby and Twaddles knew it the bus had
driven up to the post-office and there was dear
Aunt Polly waiting to welcome them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless their hearts,&#8221; she said warmly, when
she had kissed Mother and had hold of a child
with either hand. &#8220;Are they all tired out, poor
lambs? It&#8217;s a fearful place to get to, especially
the first trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom assured her sister that they
were all right, and as glad to see her as she was
to see them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I left the car around on a side street,&#8221; explained
Aunt Polly, leading the way. &#8220;You see
so many horses are still afraid of automobiles
that we think it more thoughtful not to leave
&#8217;em standing on the main street. Yes, I drove
over alone for you&ndash;&ndash;either Peter or Jud will
come over to-morrow for your trunks.&#8221;</p>
<p>This last was in response to a question Mother
Blossom had asked.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly&#8217;s car was large enough to hold
them all comfortably. Dot and Twaddles fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
into a little doze, leaning against Mother Blossom.
They had had rather a long day. But
Meg and Bobby sat up very straight and asked
questions whenever Aunt Polly was not speaking
to their mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Peter and Jud?&#8221; Bobby wanted to
know first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Apgar is my tenant farmer and runs
the farm for me,&#8221; said Aunt Polly, pulling over
to one side of the road to let a huge load of hay
go past. &#8220;Jud is his son. You&#8217;ll like Jud.
They live in a house about a quarter of a mile
from our house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Spotty?&#8221; came from Meg. &#8220;I
thought maybe you&#8217;d bring him with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotty is very lively and well,&#8221; answered
Aunt Polly. &#8220;I like a farm dog to stay at home
and watch things, so I&#8217;ve never trained him to
ride in the car with me. By the way, Meg, we
have a new addition to our animal family that
I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was immediately curious&ndash;&ndash;what was it?</p>
<p>&#8220;The blackest cat you ever saw,&#8221; said Aunt
Polly. &#8220;And I think probably the largest. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
is so shiny, and not a white hair on him! He
belonged to the people on the next farm, but
spent about half his time with me; so when they
sold and moved away last week Poots was given
to me to keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that his name&ndash;&ndash;Poots?&#8221; inquired Meg.
&#8220;How funny!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a funny cat,&#8221; replied her aunt.
&#8220;And now, children, if you look sharp you&#8217;ll see
Brookside!&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned the car into a neat graveled roadway
which parted a pretty concrete wall exactly
in half, while Twaddles was puzzling how those
things that looked to him like chickens could
ever turn into big juicy turkeys.</p>
<p>Eagerly the four little Blossoms tumbled out.
They saw a compact, modern house that looked
even from the outside as if one might find all
sorts of unexpected corners within. A green
lawn bordered each side of the driveway, and
in one direction was a red-tiled house with smoke
coming out of the chimney and in another a birdhouse
perched on a high pole near the gate the
four little Blossoms had just come through.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>Bobby spied the other house and Meg saw the
home for the birds, just as people always see
whatever they are most interested in first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flowers!&#8221; said Dot.</p>
<p>She had seen the hollyhocks that stood up
straight and tall against the fence that shut off
the back of Aunt Polly&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Peter Apgar had come up to take the car and
perhaps to see the new arrivals. The four little
Blossoms liked him at once, and when he spoke
in a soft, lazy drawl that was good-nature itself
they knew he was going to be a good friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say you&#8217;re lonesome now, Miss Polly,&#8221;
he chuckled pleasantly. He always called her
Miss Polly, never Mrs. Hayward. &#8220;And I
guess Jud is as good as useless to me the rest of
the summer. What these youngsters don&#8217;t think
up to do, he will,&#8221; the farmer added, with a
broad grin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE WRECK OF THE RAFT</h3>
</div>
<p>Though all of the four little Blossoms
protested that they were not the least bit
sleepy, it was not long after Mother and
Aunt Polly had helped them to delicious brown
bread and honey and milk and baked apples
that they were stumbling up the stairs to baths
and bed. Linda, a girl about fifteen, who lived
with Aunt Polly and went to school in the winter
and worked during the summer, had made
the two pretty bedrooms as dainty as possible and
had left a vase of flowers on the table in each
room. It was Linda, too, who brought armfuls
of clean towels and showed them which was
the hot and which the cold water in Aunt
Polly&#8217;s white and green bathroom.</p>
<p>The next day the four children and Mother
Blossom and Aunt Polly, with Linda and Jud
part of the time and Spotty and Poots in constant
attendance, explored Brookside thoroughly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>They saw the poultry yard, where ducks and
chickens and guinea-hens and one lame turkey
lived happily together. The other turkeys
roamed all over the farm, and Aunt Polly said
that at night they slept out of doors in the trees.
She said they would be sick if cooped up in
houses, and that they had to roam half-wild to
thrive.</p>
<p>The visitors called on Mrs. Sally Sweet, the
beautiful gentle Jersey cow that gave such wonderful
rich milk; they saw the seven new little
white pigs; they took salt to the sheep that were
in a stony pasture and that came running when
Peter called to them from the bars.</p>
<p>They made the acquaintance, too, of Jerry
and Terry, the two faithful farm horses, and
Nelly Bly, the brown mare who had a small colt,
Felix, by her side. Meg had to be dragged
away from the colt. She said she had never
seen such a darling little horse.</p>
<p>Jud Apgar was a tall, lanky boy, with the same
pleasant drawling way of speaking his father
had, and the &#8220;evenest temper that ever was,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Linda said. Linda should have known, because
she was a great tease.</p>
<p>On their way back from the sheep pasture
Aunt Polly and the Blossoms stopped at the tenant
house, and Mrs. Apgar asked them in to
taste of her fresh buttermilk. She had just finished
churning, and the children saw their first
churn. They admired the firm yellow butter,
but they did not care much for the buttermilk,
though Mother Blossom drank two glasses of it
and said it was delicious.</p>
<p>It was nearly dinner time now, for Aunt
Polly, like many people who live in the country,
liked to have her dinner at noon, and they all
hurried home to get freshened up for the meal.
Poor Dot, as usual, had managed to soil her
frock, and she had to be buttoned into a clean
dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you ever get that old egg on it?&#8221;
scolded Meg, nevertheless helping her to fasten
the buttons.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know eggs broke so easy,&#8221; explained
Dot. &#8220;I was looking in a nest where a hen was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
sitting, and she flew up and scared me. And I
just touched one of her eggs and it broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg happened to glance from the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter&#8217;s brought the trunks!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;And the kiddie-car and a bundle that must be
the surprise Daddy told us about. Hurry, Dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two little girls ran downstairs and found
the others gathered about the trunks and parcels
on the front porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy&#8217;s surprise!&#8221; shouted Bobby. &#8220;Let me
open it, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Blossom handed him the shears and
he cut the heavy cord. Something brown and
heavy was inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dress. No, it isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a tent! It&#8217;s a
tent and four Indian suits!&#8221; Bobby was so delighted
that he gave a war-whoop then and there
and began to do a war dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;An Indian suit!&#8221; shrieked Twaddles, trying
to stand on his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian beads!&#8221; cried Meg, holding up a long
chain of bright colored glass beads.</p>
<p>&#8220;And feathers!&#8221; Dot, too, had been digging
in the package.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>The rest of the afternoon was a busy time for
them all. Jud helped them set up the tent on
the side lawn, and then the four little Blossoms
dressed up in their new suits and played Indians
to their hearts&#8217; content. There were jackets
and trousers and feather head-dresses for Bobby
and Twaddles and squaw costumes and bead
chains for Meg and Dot. Jud made them each
a wooden hatchet, which completed the make-believe.</p>
<p>The next morning Mother Blossom had to
go back to Oak Hill. The children went as far
as the gate to say good-by to her, but both she
and Aunt Polly, who was to drive her over, not
in the car but with Nelly Bly and a smart-looking
red-wheeled buggy, thought that it was better
for them not to go to town.</p>
<p>When they had kissed her good-by and
watched the buggy till it was nothing but a cloud
of dust in the road, the four little Blossoms began
to feel very queer indeed. They had never
been alone in a strange place without any mother
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my goodness, if you&#8217;re not here,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Jud cheerily, coming up behind them. He pretended
not to see the tears beginning to splash
down Dot&#8217;s cheeks. &#8220;I&#8217;m going down to the
brook to mend the line fence, and I thought if
you wanted to come along and play in the
water&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>They did, of course. Dot slipped her hand
into Jud&#8217;s and the others followed, talking busily.
What was a line fence? How could he
fix it? What could they play in the water?</p>
<p>Jud didn&#8217;t mind questions at all. Indeed, he
rather enjoyed answering them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, this fence goes along the brook right
in the center,&#8221; he explained carefully, &#8220;to show
where your Aunt Polly&#8217;s land stops and Mr.
Simmond&#8217;s land begins. If we didn&#8217;t have a
fence there his cattle would walk right through
the brook and up into our meadows. Say, build
a raft, why don&#8217;t you? I always did when I
was a kid. Here, I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud in a few minutes had shown Bobby how
to make a little raft, and he and Twaddles finished
it while Meg and Dot ran up to the house
to get some toys to sail on it. For a raft, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
know if you have ever made one, is no fun at all
unless it has a cargo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We brought Geraldine!&#8221; cried Dot, running
back, out of breath, with her best doll. &#8220;And
now I wish I&#8217;d brought her trunk. But here&#8217;s
Meg&#8217;s &#8216;Black Beauty&#8217; book. She says we can
play that&#8217;s a trunk. It&#8217;s heavy. And Meg is
bringing your airplane, Bobby, and the singing
bird for Twaddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The singing bird was a little toy one of the
neighbors in Oak Hill had given Twaddles. It
had come from abroad, and he was very proud
of it. It was a tiny yellow wooden bird that
wound up with a key and sang three tunes for
all the world like a music box.</p>
<p>Bobby fixed the string, and the children arranged
the toys on the raft, the smiling Geraldine
occupying the place of honor in the center
and leaning gracefully against the book which
served her as a prop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Jud!&#8221; shouted Bobby. &#8220;See it float!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud, in the middle of the stream, waved his
hand encouragingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beginning to sprinkle,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
run on up to the barn, out of the wet. You&#8217;ll
find Dad working there. Tie your raft&ndash;&ndash;this is
only a shower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby obediently tied the raft to a tree root
that extended out over the water, and the four
little Blossoms, taking hold of hands, raced
madly for the barn. They were only just in
time, for as they reached the door the rain fell
in sheets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most caught you, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221; chuckled Peter,
who was mending harness in a little room that
opened on to the barn floor. &#8220;A rain like this
could drown that littlest one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; protested Dot, who was the
&#8220;littlest one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Jud will drown,&#8221; worried Bobby.
&#8220;Does he stay out in the wet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit of rain doesn&#8217;t hurt Jud,&#8221; said Peter
comfortably. &#8220;He&#8217;s used to it, and his mother
has dry clothes ready for him when he comes in.
Well now, look around, and make yourselves at
home. You can do most anything in Miss
Polly&#8217;s barn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play see-saw,&#8221; proposed Meg, pointing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
to a long board that stood in the corner.
&#8220;Could we have that, Mr. Peter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can. I&#8217;ll lay it across this saw-horse,
so, and that&#8217;s as fine a see-saw as any one
could ask for,&#8221; said Peter, lifting the heavy
plank with ease.</p>
<p>Bobby and Meg took possession of the see-saw,
and Dot and Twaddles made the simultaneous
discovery that hay was slippery. They
found this out because Twaddles had climbed
to the top of a pile of loose hay and was intending
to reach an open window when his foot
slipped and he gently slid down to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me do that,&#8221; cried Dot, hastily scrambling
up. &#8220;Watch me, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat down, gave herself a little shove and
neatly slid down the side of the hay. Then
Twaddles tried, and then they took turns.</p>
<p>Spotty appeared at the barn door, wagging his
tail engagingly. He was &#8220;part white terrier&#8221;
and &#8220;part something else&#8221; Jud had told the children,
and he had one funny black spot on his
back near his tail.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour the rain had stopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and a watery sun was struggling through the
breaking clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby!&#8221; Meg thought of something so suddenly,
she stopped the see-saw with a bump that
jarred poor Bobby&#8217;s teeth. &#8220;What do you know
about the things we left on the raft? Geraldine
will be soaked!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the wings of my airplane,&#8221; cried Bobby.
&#8220;Why, I never thought! We should have taken
the toys off. Let&#8217;s get &#8217;em now, and maybe
Linda can dry them in the kitchen for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hastily calling the twins, Meg and Bobby set
off, running for the brook. The grass was very
wet and their shoes were soaked in a few minutes.
But they didn&#8217;t mind that if only the toys
were not damaged!</p>
<p>Bobby reached the brook first. No Jud was
in sight, but a neat, firm fence showed where he
had completed his work. No raft was tied to
the root, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; gasped Meg, who had followed
Bobby closely. &#8220;My lovely book I&#8217;ve never
even read yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my airplane I meant to have such fun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
sailing out where there is lots of room,&#8221; said
Bobby mournfully. &#8220;Dot, the raft&#8217;s floated
away!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot and Twaddles came up to them and Dot
at first could not believe the bad news.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you tied it, Bobby,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;How
could it get gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say &#8216;get gone,&#8217;&#8221; said Bobby absently.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it got loose, but it has. You
can see for yourself. And all our toys are
lost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor, poor Geraldine!&#8221; sobbed Geraldine&#8217;s
little mother. &#8220;All drowned! And Twaddles&#8217;
Dicky bird! Maybe, couldn&#8217;t Jud have them,
Bobby?&#8221; she added suddenly.</p>
<p>Bobby had not thought of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You run and ask him,&#8221; he said, &#8220;while we
walk down the brook a way and look for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>LEARNING TO MILK</h3>
</div>
<p>Dot ran off to the Apgar house as fast as
her short legs would carry her, to find
Jud and ask him if he had taken their toys in
out of the rain. The other children followed
Bobby along the brook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because our feet are as wet as they can be,
now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and if Aunt Polly is going to
scold, getting them wetter won&#8217;t make her scold
any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like more rain,&#8221; worried Meg, scanning
the clouds. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go back,
Bobby, and come out after dinner? If the raft
floated as far as the woods, the trees will keep
it dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby was very damp and very hungry, and
he, too, thought that after dinner would be a
better time to hunt for the toys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Twaddles,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles was some distance ahead, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
turned so quickly that one foot slipped. Meg
and Bobby saw him tumble into the brook with
a loud splash.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t very deep, but it was very wet, and
though Bobby reached him in a second, poor
Twaddles was frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so co-old!&#8221; he wept loudly. &#8220;I want
Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t stand here all day,&#8221; said Bobby
practically. &#8220;Take hold of Meg&#8217;s hand, and
we&#8217;ll run to the house. Linda was making soup
this morning, Twaddles. Think how good nice,
hot soup will taste!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg took his hand, and, Bobby on the other
side, Twaddles ran with all his might toward
dry clothes and hot soup. It was raining hard
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, children!&#8221; Aunt Polly met them at
the door, for she had long ago come back from
taking Mother Blossom to town. &#8220;Has anything
happened? I found Dot in the hammock
crying for her doll and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;But Twaddles is
dripping!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He fell in the brook,&#8221; explained Bobby concisely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor lamb!&#8221; comforted Aunt Polly. &#8220;Come
upstairs, dear, and Auntie will see that you&#8217;re
rubbed dry. And Bobby and Meg, don&#8217;t stand
around in those wet shoes one minute. Change
them immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later four clean, dry little Blossoms
were at the table enjoying Linda&#8217;s delicious
soup and other good things. The day had
turned to a cold, rainy, dismal one, very different
from the promise of the sunny summer
morning. Aunt Polly said they would have to
manufacture their own sunshine that afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think of going to hunt for the
toys till to-morrow, and only then if it&#8217;s clear,&#8221;
she announced firmly. &#8220;Likely as not the raft
sank, and you mustn&#8217;t feel too bad about the
toys. You&#8217;ll find plenty of other things to play
with on the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>All that afternoon it poured, and all that
afternoon the four little Blossoms spent in
Linda&#8217;s kitchen cooking and pulling molasses
candy. They had the sweetiest, stickiest time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
you ever heard of, and when about six o&#8217;clock
the rain stopped and the sun came out pure yellow
gold, they had a plate of beautiful cream-colored
candy to take to Mrs. Peter Apgar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants to help me milk?&#8221; asked Jud,
passing the kitchen door as they were talking to
his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jud, I do!&#8221; begged Meg. &#8220;You promised
to show me how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all come,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;Aunt Polly
isn&#8217;t going to have supper till seven o&#8217;clock to-night,
&#8217;cause the minister is coming. We&#8217;ve got
oceans of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot looks dressed up to me,&#8221; announced Jud.
&#8220;Keep her out of the mud, somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my prettiest dress,&#8221; said Dot serenely,
smoothing down the folds of her white
dotted swiss under her coral-colored sweater.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sally Sweet looked mildly interested
when she saw such a number of people coming
into her comfortable barnyard, and when Jud
drove her into the barn and fastened her in the
stanchion, all the children stood around to
watch.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>When Jud had the pail nearly full of milk,
he rose carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Meg,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you sit here. Easy
now; don&#8217;t be nervous. Don&#8217;t you know a cow
won&#8217;t give milk if she knows you&#8217;re nervous?
Now work your fingers like this&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg sat on the three-legged stool and tried to
do exactly as Jud told her. Bobby and Dot and
Twaddles stared at her open-mouthed. She was
actually milking a live cow!</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep right on; that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; encouraged Jud.
&#8220;You&#8217;re doing first rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>His father called him just then, and he ran to
the door to see what was wanted. Meg, beaming,
kept on milking. All would have been well
if Mrs. Sally Sweet hadn&#8217;t remembered her calf,
Buttercup, and opened her mouth to give a tremendous
and unexpected, &#8220;<i>Moo!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms were sadly startled.
Meg jumped up, upsetting the pail of milk over
herself and Bobby, who stood nearest, and
knocking down Twaddles and Dot who were
close behind her. As luck would have it, both
twins pitched into a heap of soft hay and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
not hurt at all. But when they scrambled to
their feet, alas! streams of yellow, bright yellow,
decorated Dot&#8217;s sweater and dress and splashed
Twaddles&#8217; middy blouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake!&#8221; cried Jud, coming back
in time to view this wholesale damage. &#8220;What
have you been up to now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must have been eggs in that hay,&#8221; said
Twaddles disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some hen stole her nest, and you&#8217;ve finished
her hopes,&#8221; sighed Jud. &#8220;I must say you&#8217;re a
sweet looking mess. Wonder what Miss Polly
will say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My! and the minister&#8217;s coming to supper,&#8221;
announced Bobby, remembering this for the first
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you looked dressed up,&#8221; Jud
groaned. &#8220;I suppose I ought to have paid more
attention. Well, come on, we&#8217;ll go up the back
way and I&#8217;ll tell Miss Polly most of it was my
fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms, eggy and milky, followed
Jud up to the house. He meant to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
them in through the kitchen in case the minister
should be on the front porch and so spare Aunt
Polly&#8217;s company the sight of such a forlorn procession.
But, just as they rounded the back of
the house, they met Aunt Polly showing the minister
and his wife her kitchen garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twaddles!&#8221; gasped poor Aunt Polly, for
Twaddles was ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;we were learning to milk,&#8221; said
Meg apologetically.</p>
<p>The minister and his wife took one look at
the four, and then they sat down on the back
doorstep and laughed and laughed. After a
minute Aunt Polly joined them, and then the
children and Jud began to giggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry and get into something clean,&#8221; commanded
Aunt Polly, wiping her eyes. &#8220;Linda
is just putting supper on the table. I don&#8217;t care
what you put on, as long as it is clean. I spent
an hour dressing you, and now see the result.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms made haste to scurry
into clean suits and dresses, and in a short time
were ready to come downstairs and meet the
minister and his wife properly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning,&#8221; said Bobby, as Aunt
Polly put out the light and kissed them good-night,
&#8220;we must go and hunt for the raft.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the morning Peter Apgar rattled up to
the door while they were still at the breakfast
table, with Jerry and Terry harnessed to an
empty wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody here want to go over to the mill
with me?&#8221; he called loudly.</p>
<p>Of course the four children were wild to go,
and Aunt Polly said that she was sure Peter had
room for every one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take good care of them, Peter,&#8221; she said,
following them down to the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised Peter. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an old
quilt spread down in the bottom for them to sit
on. If the jolting tires &#8217;em two can sit up with
me, taking turns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotty wagged his tail as they drove off, but
he would not follow the wagon. He knew it
was his place to stay and take care of Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>The mill was about four miles from Brookside,
and the children enjoyed the drive intensely.
Good-natured Peter allowed each one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
to &#8220;drive,&#8221; holding the reins carefully as he told
them, &#8220;Because,&#8221; said Peter seriously, &#8220;even if
you&#8217;re only learning, you might as well begin
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the mill, Jerry and Terry
were tied to a post and Peter and the children
went inside. Bobby was rather disappointed
with the outside of the mill; he had expected it
to look like the mills he saw in pictures, with
great wide sails flattened against the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Electric power runs this mill,&#8221; Peter explained
when Bobby asked where the sails were.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find plenty to see inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>A short, stout man in a dusty white coat met
them, and Peter gave him his order.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve some little folks from down the state a
way with me,&#8221; Peter told the man. &#8220;Guess you
can show &#8217;em round the mill a bit this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; was the hearty answer.
&#8220;Come along, everybody, and we&#8217;ll see just how
grain is milled.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a real flour mill. That is, not one
of the great mills that turn millions of bushels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
of wheat into flour; but it did grind buckwheat
for the farmers and made coarse flour and feed
for their stock, cracked corn for poultry and so
on. The four little Blossoms saw much to interest
them, but the great round stones that
ground the grains and the arrangements for sifting
the dust and chaff from the grain interested
them the most.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be fun to be a miller!&#8221; said Bobby,
when they were ready to go and the noon whistle
blew and the big stones stopped turning as the
power was shut off. &#8220;Maybe when I grow up
I&#8217;ll run a mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rattling home in the big wagon with two
sacks of &#8220;middlings&#8221; in the back with them,
Twaddles and Dot decided that they, too, would
have a mill some day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>LOST IN THE WOODS</h3>
</div>
<p>Right after dinner the four children
started to hunt for the lost raft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have gone down the brook,&#8221; argued
Bobby, as they walked along. &#8220;Jud says
things always float with the current. So we&#8217;ll
start on Mr. Simmond&#8217;s land and walk slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>They scrambled under the line fence, and Dot
only tore one of the ruffles off her frock. They
went on and on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re almost to the woods,&#8221; said Meg, as
they dropped down under a ragged buttonwood
tree to rest. &#8220;Where do you suppose the brook
goes? Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to follow it through
the woods and see what&#8217;s on the other side!&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms thought this would
be great fun. They had not been in the woods
yet, though Jud and Linda had promised to take
them some day and Aunt Polly said it was the
nicest kind of a place for picnics.</p>
<p>The children stood up, and shaded their eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
their hands. They could just see the eaves
of the barn and the chimneys of Aunt Polly&#8217;s
house and the Apgar house. The brook twisted
and turned so often, they had really walked further
than they guessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s dark in the woods,&#8221; said Twaddles,
marching ahead. &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s bears
and things in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t begin and scare Dot,&#8221; admonished
Bobby. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take hold of hands. My, isn&#8217;t
it nice and cool!&#8221;</p>
<p>They stepped from the sunny glare of the
brook pasture into the cool, dark, rustly stillness
of the beautiful woods. A chipmunk ran across
their path, and tall ferns grew higher than their
heads on either side of the brook.</p>
<p>Almost unconsciously the children left the
brook and struck off into a pretty path that was
laid with stepping stones and led up a slight hill.
They saw two rabbits and heard gray squirrels
chattering in the trees overhead. One squirrel
came down and stared gravely at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he pretty?&#8221; said Meg. &#8220;I wish he&#8217;d let
me pat him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>A shriek from Dot startled them all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a snake!&#8221; she cried, running to Meg.
&#8220;A horrid, nasty little green one. And now I&#8217;ve
lost my flowers!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the bouquet she had been picking
was scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you care,&#8221; Meg comforted her. &#8220;It
was only a baby water snake. Aunt Polly told
Mother that&#8217;s the only kind that lives round
here. Honestly, snakes are all right, Dot. Lots
of people don&#8217;t mind &#8217;em a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do,&#8221; said Dot decidedly. &#8220;They
wiggle so. Let&#8217;s go home anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better,&#8221; announced Bobby. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what time it is, but I guess there&#8217;s
no use looking for the raft any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The raft?&#8221; echoed Meg. &#8220;Oh Bobby,
where is the brook?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby grinned a little sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We forgot about the raft, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see&ndash;&ndash;we came down that path&ndash;&ndash;the
brook must be over there. Come on, Dot,
we&#8217;re going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot sat down on the ground and began to cry.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be lost,&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;I&#8217;m
hungry, and my feet hurt! And I&#8217;m so tired!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg put her arms around her sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; she urged her bravely. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not lost, are we, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby and Meg, as the two older, felt that
they must keep the twins from becoming discouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course we&#8217;re not lost,&#8221; asserted Bobby
stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course not,&#8221; echoed Meg. &#8220;I think the
brook is right past those three big trees. Come
on, Dot, let&#8217;s run and see who gets there first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot allowed herself to be pulled to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll count for you,&#8221; said Bobby, glad to see
her stop crying. &#8220;One&ndash;&ndash;two&ndash;&ndash;three&ndash;&ndash;go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Away went Meg and Dot. Meg had intended
to let Dot win, because she was so much
smaller she couldn&#8217;t be expected to run as well
as her older sister. But Meg&#8217;s good intentions
came to nothing. Dot had an unfortunate habit
of shutting her eyes tight when she ran, and the
woods, of all places, are where it pays to keep
one&#8217;s eyes wide open. Poor Dot, running over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
the uneven ground with her eyes closed, crashed
headlong into a wild blackberry bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ow!&#8221; she wailed shrilly. &#8220;Meg, Meg!
Ow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face and hands were scratched and bleeding
and her dress was badly torn by the time
Meg and Bobby got her free from the prickly
bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; sobbed the unfortunate child,
rubbing her smarting face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lie down in the
grass and the birds can cover me with leaves.
Nasty old woods!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll have to come,&#8221; urged Bobby. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve it&#8217;s much further, Dot. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll take of my shoes and stockings,&#8221;
said Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her feet are all puffed up,&#8221; said Meg, unbuttoning
the little tan shoes. &#8220;Poor sister!
But you can&#8217;t go barefoot through here&ndash;&ndash;the
Stones and things are too sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll cut you,&#8221; said Twaddles, who was
watching anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make a chair with our hands and carry
her,&#8221; suggested Bobby.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>So Meg and Bobby joined hands and managed
to start off comfortably, carrying Dot.</p>
<p>Twaddles looked at them anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting dark,&#8221; he quavered.</p>
<p>It was, too, a shadowy gray dusk there in the
woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s only &#8217;cause there&#8217;s so many trees,&#8221;
said Meg cheerfully. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be dark out in
the fields yet. I don&#8217;t believe Jud has even
started to milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>They took up Dot again and went ahead, but
it grew more and more difficult to follow the
path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where we were when you stopped to
get your breath,&#8221; declared Twaddles positively
as they came into an open space. &#8220;I &#8217;member
that rotten log on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true. They had been walking in a circle!</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried Meg, starting up in sudden
fright.</p>
<p>The twins clung to her, hiding their faces in
her skirt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I saw something move&ndash;&ndash;over there in those
bushes,&#8221; whispered Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;a bear?&#8221; asked Meg softly.</p>
<p>But Dot heard her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bear!&#8221; she shrieked. &#8220;Twaddles, Meg,
Bobby, come quick! It&#8217;s a bear!&#8221;</p>
<p>Something bounded out of the bushes and
leaped upon them with shrill, sharp barks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotty!&#8221; chorused the children. &#8220;You dear,
darling old Spotty! Where did you come
from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotty was apparently as glad to see them,
and in his way tried to tell them so. He jumped
up and down, barked excitedly and licked their
hands and faces over and over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ll bet you Spotty knows the way
home!&#8221; Bobby jumped to his feet as this thought
came to him. &#8220;Spotty, show us the way home,
that&#8217;s a good dog. Home, Spotty!&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotty wagged his tail heartily and barked
once. Then he rushed a little way ahead and
turned to look at the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he seemed to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does know,&#8221; agreed Meg excitedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
&#8220;Put your shoes on, Dot. All take hold of hands
and hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were in such haste they put the left shoe
on Dot&#8217;s right foot and the right one on her left,
but she never even noticed it. Taking hold of
hands, the four little Blossoms scurried through
the dark woods, for it was pitch dark now, after
Spotty. The dog kept just a little way ahead,
and now and then he barked as if to tell them
that everything was all right.</p>
<p>It was not easy walking in the dark, and they
tripped and stumbled over tree roots and unsuspected
stones. But at last they came out into
the open. The stars were shining overhead, and
it was night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we?&#8221; asked Meg in wonder.
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the brook pasture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the gate light!&#8221; cried Bobby suddenly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE BLOSSOMS GO BERRYING</h3>
</div>
<p>Sure enough, ahead of them twinkled the
pretty ornamental light that Aunt Polly
had lighted on dark nights to show where
the driveway went through the gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in back of the house!&#8221; cried Meg.
&#8220;See, that&#8217;s the kitchen window where the white
curtain is. Don&#8217;t things look different at
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221; came Jud&#8217;s clear call.
&#8220;Bobby, Meg, is that you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then as Bobby answered him, they heard Jud
shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, folks, they&#8217;ve come. I told you
they were all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter and Jud and a neighbor&#8217;s boy came running
toward the children, swinging lanterns, and
followed by Mrs. Peter Apgar and Aunt Polly
and Linda. Such a time as there was, and such
a hugging and kissing and explaining!</p>
<p>&#8220;When you didn&#8217;t come home to supper, I began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
to worry,&#8221; said dear Aunt Polly, carrying
Dot, big girl as she was. Peter had picked up
Meg, and Jud had shouldered Twaddles, while
Bobby kept running beside them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be starved,&#8221; was Linda&#8217;s greeting.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got fried chicken and currant jelly,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>And though it was late, Aunt Polly was sure
that fried chicken would hurt no one, and while
the hungry Blossoms ate, she sat by and listened
to what had happened to them in the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, darlings,&#8221; she cried over and over,
&#8220;Auntie will buy you other books and toys, but
I couldn&#8217;t possibly buy your mother other children
if anything happened to you. Look at
Dot&#8217;s feet; the poor child must have walked
miles. And her face and hands are terribly
scratched.&#8221;</p>
<p>Directly after supper the tired children were
ready for bed, and Linda and Aunt Polly undressed
them and bathed the sore little feet and
put soothing cold cream on sunburned, scratched
little faces.</p>
<p>The summer weeks flew merrily by, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
a rainy afternoon came and Aunt Polly suggested
that the children should write to their
father and mother, the Blossoms discovered that
they really had a good deal to tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll begin, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m the oldest and I can
write in pencil,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;Then Meg can
print, and I&#8217;ll write what Dot and Twaddles
tell me to. I guess they will like that kind of
letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Polly thought so, too, and she gave
Bobby her own pretty mahogany &#8220;secretary&#8221;
that was ever so old a desk, to write at.</p>
<p>Bobby put his tongue in his cheek and worked
hard for fifteen minutes. Then he was ready
to read aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dear Daddy and Mother:&#8217;&#8221; he read. &#8220;&#8216;We
thought you would like to hear from us. Last
week Peter was haying and Meg and I helped
him make loads. Meg drove into the barn all
by herself. It is fun to see them unload the hay,
because they have a thing they call a hayfork
that comes down and takes up big handfuls and
carries it up to the mow. I can almost milk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
The twins are very good most of the time. Your
loving son, Robert Hayward Blossom.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Will they know that&#8217;s from you?&#8221; asked Meg
doubtfully, slipping into the chair at the desk
and taking up the pencil to print her letter.
&#8220;You never call yourself Robert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I know how to write a letter,&#8221; Bobby
informed her with dignity. &#8220;You always sign
your real names to letters, don&#8217;t you, Aunt
Polly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, dear,&#8221; said Aunt Polly, who was
doing something to a pair of overalls.</p>
<p>Meg printed slowly and carefully, and soon
her letter was ready to be read aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dear Daddy and Mother,&#8217;&#8221; she began
proudly. &#8220;&#8216;We hope you are well. We are.
Dot most wasn&#8217;t, but I took care of her. She
went out to the barn to hunt for eggs, and the
turkey gobbler saw her. He thought she was
carrying corn in the basket. He chased her and
she ran. I heard her crying and I ran down to
the barn. She was backed up into a corner and
he was making noises at her. He is awful big,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
but I am not afraid of him. I grabbed the
broom Jud keeps to sweep the barn floor with
and I chased that old gobbler clear into the
orchard. We are going to pick berries to-morrow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The twins had kept still as long as they could,
and now it was their turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Mother &#8217;bout the snake I saw this morning,&#8221;
said Twaddles. &#8220;Jud says it was a black
snake after baby robins. It was on the grape arbor
where there is a robin&#8217;s nest. Jud killed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Daddy I weeded a whole onion row for
Aunt Polly,&#8221; begged Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, I have to sign my name,&#8221; interrupted
Meg.</p>
<p>And she signed it, &#8220;Margaret Alice Blossom,&#8221;
right in among the words of the twins&#8217; letters
that Bobby was patiently writing.</p>
<p>The next day was very warm, and Aunt Polly
thought they had better play in the orchard instead
of picking berries, so they trooped out
soon after breakfast, to find the orchard cool and
shady.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had my book that was drowned,&#8221;
mourned Meg. &#8220;I love to sit up in a tree and
read.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I loved Geraldine better than Tottie-Fay,&#8221;
said Dot, giving the old doll a shake as she
spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use fussing,&#8221; advised the sensible Bobby.
&#8220;They&#8217;re lost, and we mustn&#8217;t let Aunt Polly
hear us, &#8217;cause she&#8217;ll think she ought to go right
off and buy us some more. I&#8217;m going to climb
this tree. Who wants a ripe apple?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; and Meg jumped up. &#8220;Let me hold
my apron and you throw &#8217;em down, Bobby.
Twaddles, stop teasing Spotty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I aren&#8217;t teasing him,&#8221; declared Twaddles indignantly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to teach him to carry
bundles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles&#8217; method of teaching the patient
Spotty was to sit down on him with feet spread
wide apart and wait for the dog to shake him
off.</p>
<p>Dot sat down quietly in the grass and began
to make a bouquet of wild-flowers. It was Dot
who always helped Aunt Polly weed and water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
her flower garden, and Dot who liked to see
fresh flowers on the dining-room table.</p>
<p>When Meg had her apron full of apples she
sat down near Dot, and the four ate as many
sweet summer apples as four small people could
who had eaten breakfast less than an hour before.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Poots,&#8221; said Meg suddenly, glancing
up and seeing the black cat picking her way
through the grass. &#8220;Do you suppose she is
hunting birds?&#8221;</p>
<p>Poots blinked her green eyes innocently. If
she were after birds, she had no intention of
catching any before an audience. She sat down
and began to wash her face.</p>
<p>A mischievous idea seized Twaddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rats, Spotty!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Rats!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now rats sounds pretty much like &#8220;cats,&#8221; and
the excited and startled Spotty did not stop to
question which word Twaddles had used. He
jumped up, his ears pointing forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rats, sic &#8217;em!&#8221; said bad little Twaddles.
&#8220;Rats, Spotty!&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotty barked twice sharply. Poots arose, her
fur bristling. Spotty leaped at her, barking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
playfully. Away ran Poots, her black tail sticking
straight up in the air. And after them raced
the four little Blossoms, shouting and calling
frantically.</p>
<p>Poots ran straight for the front wall and
scrambled up it, leaving Spotty to bark wildly
on the ground and make futile rushes at the solid
wall he couldn&#8217;t hope to climb. Some of the
masonry was loose, and Poots, digging with her
sharp claws, sent down a shower of dust into
the dog&#8217;s eyes. He whined, and dug at his eyes
with both forepaws. Then he sneezed several
times.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will chase me, will you?&#8221; Poots seemed
to say, gazing down at him from her safe position.
&#8220;The idea!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we might as well pick up some of this
stuff,&#8221; said Twaddles, knowing that the fun was
over.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cooler&ndash;&ndash;just feel that breeze!&#8221; exclaimed
Meg. &#8220;Let&#8217;s ask Aunt Polly if we can&#8217;t
go berrying after dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Polly obligingly said they could, and
after dinner the four little Blossoms scrambled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
into overalls Aunt Polly had bought and shortened
to fit them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish your mother could see you,&#8221; she said,
as she gave them each a bright tin pail. &#8220;No
need to worry about your dress now, is there,
Dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going berrying?&#8221; asked Jud, as they passed
him, clipping the green hedge around the
kitchen garden. &#8220;Better keep out of the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children walked down the road and
turned into another field. They knew where
the blackberry bushes grew, and they meant to
fill their pails.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s start here by this fence,&#8221; suggested
Bobby. &#8220;What&#8217;s that over in Mr. Simmond&#8217;s
field?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bull,&#8221; answered Meg who knew all the
animals at Brookside and on the neighboring
farms by this time. &#8220;He&#8217;s as cross as can be, but
he took three prizes at the last Fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles ate the first dozen berries he picked
and then he picked another dozen for Dot&#8217;s pail.
He decided that larger and better berries grew
on the other side of the fence. He crawled under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and his shout of delight brought the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never saw such big ones!&#8221; cried Twaddles
gleefully. &#8220;Meg, look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are big,&#8221; agreed Meg. &#8220;Come on,
Bobby, let&#8217;s go on the other side. Mr. Simmonds
won&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot was already under the fence, and Meg
and Bobby stooped down and crawled under
after her.</p>
<p>The four little figures in blue overalls began
to pick industriously. The berries were thick
and juicy, and the bottoms of the tin pails were
covered in a few minutes. Meg had just
stopped to pull a briar from her thumb when
she heard a bellow behind her.</p>
<p>There stood the bull, in the middle of the
field, his head down between his knees, his feet
pawing the ground, and his angry eyes glaring
at the berry pickers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bobby! The bull!&#8221; gasped Meg. &#8220;Run,
Dot and Twaddles!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE HOME LAUNDRY</h3>
</div>
<p>Dot and Twaddles took one frightened
look at the bellowing bull, and then
dropped flat on the ground and began to
squirm under the fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry, Meg,&#8221; urged Bobby. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stand
there like that! Run!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for you,&#8221; quavered Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, hurry,&#8221; repeated Bobby.</p>
<p>He and Meg crawled under the fence and
stood beside Twaddles and Dot. Then they
looked over at the bull. He was not charging
directly toward them, but at something else his
angry red eyes had seen even before the children
noticed it. Further down there was a gap in
the fence where several rails were broken.</p>
<p>Meg shrieked in terror as she saw what the
bull meant to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter! Jud! Aunt Polly! Come quick!&#8221;
she screamed, hardly knowing what she was crying.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Coming!&#8221; called a big voice, and over the
fence corner sprang Peter Apgar, a pitchfork
in his hand. He had been gathering up the
loose hay left along the edge of the field after
the hayloader had gathered the main crop.</p>
<p>After Peter came Spotty, who met the bull
just as that cross animal&#8217;s nose appeared at the
gap in the fence. Indeed, Spotty met him so
suddenly that both grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll turn him. You stay back here out of
sight,&#8221; commanded Peter, running past the four
little Blossoms.</p>
<p>The children were very glad to stay huddled
behind the bushes, but they couldn&#8217;t help peeping
out now and then to see what Peter and
Spotty were doing with the bull.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woof, woof!&#8221; barked Spotty.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, will you?&#8221; shouted Peter.</p>
<p>He jabbed the bull with the pitchfork, and
that surprised beast turned with a bellow. Holding
the pitchfork so that it would not hurt him
unless he tried to come at him, Peter forced the
bull back through the fence, and then he and
Spotty drove him across the field.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>Presently Peter and the dog came back, a bit
warm and breathless, and very glad the four
little Blossoms were to see them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can finish berrying in peace,&#8221; said Peter.
&#8220;I drove the bull into Simmonds&#8217; barnyard and
told his man to keep him there. No farmer has
a right to leave a cross bull at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children set to work at the berries again,
and, as nothing further happened to disturb
them, they filled all four pails before supper
time. Bobby and Meg helped the twins a little,
and maybe they weren&#8217;t proud to have berries
of their own picking and cream, as Meg
said, of their own milking, for their supper that
night! And there were enough berries left over
for four small turnovers. Aunt Polly made this
pleasant announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I intended to bake cookies to-morrow morning,&#8221;
she said, smiling. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t know why
I shouldn&#8217;t make turnovers, too, and maybe
doughnuts. Perhaps some one would like to
keep me company? Linda is going to spend the
day with her mother in town, and like as not I
shall be lonesome.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all keep you company,&#8221; promised
Bobby gravely.</p>
<p>So the next morning every one was up early
because Linda wanted to have breakfast cleared
away before Jud drove her over to town. Soon
after she was gone Aunt Polly put on a large
white apron and the four children trooped into
the pleasant kitchen after her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; thought Aunt Polly out loud.
&#8220;Meg should have an apron. Suppose I tie one
of Linda&#8217;s around your neck, dear? Hers are
shorter than mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a very short time Aunt Polly had rolled
out the crust for the turnovers and filled them
with berries and sugar.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they are done you can take them outdoors
and eat them while they&#8217;re hot,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Make believe you&#8217;re having a picnic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we have a picnic, a real picnic?&#8221; asked
Bobby quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; agreed Aunt Polly. &#8220;I
meant you should have a picnic weeks ago.
Only time goes so fast. However, before vacation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
is over we&#8217;ll have a real picnic with all
kinds of good things to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every one was very much interested in the
first batch of cookies, and Aunt Polly gave each
one a sample, which was pronounced delicious.</p>
<p>Then Aunt Polly put on her big kettle and
started to fry some doughnuts.</p>
<p>Dot, when no one was looking, took Spotty
out into the hall and gave him half a cookie.
Then they both came back into the kitchen wearing
such an innocent air that Aunt Polly had to
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotty has a sweet tooth, all right,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him tease all your cookies
away from you, dear. Twaddles, look out!&#8221;</p>
<p>The warning came too late, for Twaddles,
reaching across the bowl of freshly fried doughnuts
to get something, caught his sleeve on the
rim of the bowl and succeeded in turning the
whole thing upside down over himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think,&#8221; said patient, long-suffering
Aunt Polly, when the doughnuts had been
picked up and brushed off and Twaddles had
explained how it happened, &#8220;I really think, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
four children and a dog are too many to have
in the kitchen on baking day. Anyway, the
turnovers are done. I&#8217;ll slip them on a plate
and let Meg carry it out under the chestnut
tree. Then you may have your picnic.&#8221; And
so it was settled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; confided Meg, as she bit into a juicy
bit of pie&ndash;&ndash;Aunt Polly made wonderful berry
pies&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I had my &#8216;Black Beauty&#8217; book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never have another doll like Geraldine!&#8221;
sighed Dot. &#8220;Never! And what good are all
her clothes? I haven&#8217;t any doll to fit &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might take a tuck in &#8217;em for Totty-Fat,&#8221;
suggested Bobby, using the disrespectful
name he had invented for Dot&#8217;s old doll. &#8220;She&#8217;s
a sight. Oh dear! I wish I had tried to fly my
airplane just once before I lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s my bird,&#8221; mourned Twaddles.
&#8220;Aunt Polly never heard it sing. And now she
never will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dripped a little juice on my dress,&#8221; announced
Dot doubtfully, after Meg had gone in
to help her aunt wash dishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you had,&#8221; said Bobby, gazing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
severely at the little girl. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe blackberry
juice comes out, either. Prob&#8217;ly that
dress will always be spotted now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Linda said when she was a little girl her
mother made her wash her own dresses if she
got too many dirty in one day,&#8221; Dot declared.
&#8220;Maybe I could wash this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles and Bobby hadn&#8217;t a very clear idea
of how to wash a dress, and because it was something
they had not done before, the idea appealed
to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help you,&#8221; offered Bobby generously.
&#8220;I saw a piece of soap out at the barn this morning.
And the rain barrel&#8217;s full. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>They trotted down to the barn. Neither
Peter nor Jud was anywhere in sight, which
was just what the washers hoped for. Of
course, they argued, it wasn&#8217;t naughty to wash
a dress, but you never can tell what objections
grown-ups are going to make. Sometimes they
find fault with every single thing one wants
to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me rub the soap on,&#8221; begged Dot, as
Bobby unbuttoned her frock for her and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
stepped out of it, a sturdy little figure in a brief
white petticoat.</p>
<p>So Dot rubbed plenty of soap on the blackberry
spots. It was harness soap, which Jud
had been using for the leather harness, but the
children thought it made a fine lather. Linda
would have scolded had she seen them, for soap
sets fruit juice stains so that it is almost impossible
ever to get them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put in our handkerchiefs, too,&#8221; suggested
Bobby, pulling out a grimy square.</p>
<p>Twaddles had lost his, and Dot&#8217;s was in the
pocket of her dress and already wet, but Bobby
added his to the wash.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must let &#8217;em soak,&#8221; advised Dot, who had
been in the kitchen on wash days. &#8220;Linda says
that gets the dirt out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three children balanced themselves on
the edge of the rain barrel while they waited
for their wash to soak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for pity&#8217;s sake, what are you up to
now?&#8221; It was Jud&#8217;s voice, and Jud came out of
the barn so unexpectedly that he made them
jump.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>Twaddles tumbled to his knees, and Bobby
stood up, but poor Dot lost her shaky balance
and fell into the barrel with her dress and the
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, sister, you&#8217;re not hurt,&#8221; soothed
Jud, as he pulled the dripping child out and
stood her on the grass. &#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t
yell like that. Miss Polly will think you&#8217;re
killed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot was frightened and wet, and she had no
intention of smiling at such misfortune. She
cried so loud that Aunt Polly heard her and
came running down to the barn, Meg running
behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Baby!&#8221; Aunt Polly was surprised to
see streams of water running off her small niece,
and at first she did not notice that Dot had no
dress on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your dress?&#8221; demanded Meg.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly picked up Dot, wet as she was,
and started back to the house. Meg followed
to help find clean dry clothes.</p>
<p>Jud looked at Twaddles and Bobby queerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what were you doing?&#8221; he asked in a different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
voice than they had ever heard from easygoing,
good-natured Jud. &#8220;What&#8217;s that in the
barrel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were helping Dot,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;She
got juice all on her dress, and, honest, she&#8217;s worn
eleven this week. So we thought we ought to
wash this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied Jud slowly. &#8220;Do you know
you&#8217;ve spoiled a barrel of soft rain water that&#8217;s
worth considerable? To say nothing of soap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We used the green soap we found on the
beam,&#8221; put in Twaddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You perfect imps!&#8221; groaned poor Jud.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my harness soap. I don&#8217;t see how your
town gets along with all four of you the year
around. Well, you can just help me bail out
this water&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s flat. Wring out that pesky
wash and spread it on the grass to dry. Then
each of you take one of those lard pails, and
set to work.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>UP ON THE MOUNTAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Two subdued little boys went in to dinner
that noon. Afterward Aunt Polly announced
that she was going over to town.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to drive Nelly Bly,&#8221; she told them,
&#8220;and as I couldn&#8217;t take but one, I don&#8217;t think
it is fair to take any of you. As soon as the car
is fixed, we&#8217;ll have a long drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud had taken the automobile over to the one
garage the week before and it was not ready yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now try to amuse yourselves and don&#8217;t get
into mischief,&#8221; cautioned Aunt Polly, as Jud
brought Nelly Bly and the buggy to the door.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I have to leave you when Linda is
away, but you&#8217;ll be all right. Jud will be within
call, and I&#8217;ll be back about five. I&#8217;m going to
pick up Linda and bring her back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do, Jud?&#8221; asked Dot,
as Aunt Polly drove out of the gate. Dot was
in a clean dry dress and none the worse for her
ducking.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we help you?&#8221; asked Meg kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here,&#8221; Jud said, in his pleasant,
slow voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be all-fired busy in
the back garden. If anything frightens you,
sing out and I&#8217;ll hear you. If you want to talk
to any one, go down to the house, and Mother
will listen to you. But please don&#8217;t bother me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; persisted Bobby.</p>
<p>Jud pointed to the tent that had been Father
Blossom&#8217;s surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Play Indians, why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ve had those clothes on three
times since you got &#8217;em. If any one had sent me
a tent when I was a kid, you couldn&#8217;t have kept
me from playing with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well play Indian,&#8221; said Meg,
when Jud had gone off to his garden, whistling.
&#8220;Dot and I&#8217;ll put on our suits and you and
Twaddles wear yours. I wish I had a tomahawk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl Indians don&#8217;t have &#8217;em,&#8221; said Bobby
flatly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they ought to,&#8221; declared Meg.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t Dot look cunning in her suit?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Heap big Injun chief,&#8221; announced Bobby,
prancing about in his suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get captives and hide them in the tent,&#8221;
suggested Meg, who usually did most of the
planning for their games.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;ll we get &#8217;em?&#8221; asked Bobby doubtfully.
&#8220;Jud&#8217;s bigger than we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we can&#8217;t capture Jud,&#8221; agreed Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow! wow! Whoop!&#8221; shouted Twaddles,
tumbling down the steps and giving his best Indian
yell as he came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ducks and chickens might be captives,&#8221; said
Meg slowly, frowning at the interruption of
Twaddles.</p>
<p>Ordinarily Meg was a good little girl and not
given to mischief, but a spice of naughtiness
seemed to be in all the four little Blossoms on
this unfortunate day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get the ducks, first,&#8221; said Bobby.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a great idea, Meg. Come on, Twaddles,
we have to capture the ducks.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found the beautiful white birds swimming
lazily about the artificial duck pond in the
chicken yard, and they didn&#8217;t seem to want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
be captured at all. The children finally succeeded
in driving them, twenty of them, that is,
into the tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody will have to stay and see they
don&#8217;t come out when we get the chickens,&#8221; said
Meg. &#8220;Dot&#8217;s too little&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;ll let &#8217;em out. I&#8217;ll
do it, if you&#8217;ll stay when we get the chickens in,
and let me capture the turkeys, Bobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby assented, and Meg stayed behind at the
tent while Dot, Twaddles and Bobby went after
the chickens.</p>
<p>If you have ever tried to drive a hen into a
certain place, you will know how very stupid
she can be. The children were hot and cross
before they had twenty-eight white leghorn hens
penned in the tent with the ducks.</p>
<p>&#8220;They make an awful lot of noise,&#8221; said
Bobby nervously. &#8220;Jud will hear them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as they find it&#8217;s dark they&#8217;ll think
it&#8217;s night,&#8221; answered Meg comfortably. &#8220;Now
I&#8217;m going after turkeys.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the only turkey she could find was the
lame one that lived in the chicken yard and was
tame enough to allow herself to be picked up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they good and quiet?&#8221; said Meg with
satisfaction, as she poked the patient turkey hen
through the tent flaps and heard the soft mutterings
of the ducks and hens, who thought it
was night and time to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Just as the Indians had the last captive snugly
fastened in, Peter, with Terry harnessed to the
&#8220;market wagon,&#8221; a light wagon that was used
to take the butter and eggs over to town in, came
down the drive from the barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221; said Peter to Terry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Peter!&#8221; The four little Blossoms
rushed out to greet him. &#8220;Where are you going?
Can&#8217;t we go? Where&#8217;s Jerry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter surveyed the four Indians gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as I&#8217;m going up in the mountain, I
guess we won&#8217;t meet any one who&#8217;ll be scared to
death,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;So I don&#8217;t know but
perhaps you might hop in. Jerry? I left him
in the stable. This wagon goes with one horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the children scrambled in, Peter thought of
something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not Miss Polly&#8217;ll be back before we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
are,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;She might miss all four of
you if no one&#8217;s about. Jud!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; shouted Jud from the back garden.</p>
<p>He came to the gate in the hedge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jud, if Miss Polly comes home and doesn&#8217;t
find any children, just tell her they&#8217;re with me
and that we&#8217;ll be home by six. I&#8217;m going up
in the mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jud.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you go up in the mountain?&#8221; inquired
Meg curiously, as they turned into the
road.</p>
<p>She was sitting on the front seat with Peter,
Twaddles was between them, and Dot was in
her lap. Bobby stood up in the wagon behind
them and looked over their shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I mean up on the mountain,&#8221; Peter
corrected himself. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got kind of a habit
round here of saying &#8216;in the mountain.&#8217; Ever
been up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms had never been there&ndash;&ndash;indeed
they did not know there was a mountain
near by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose it&#8217;s more of a hill,&#8221; admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
Peter. &#8220;But it&#8217;s the best mountain we have.
Queer people live up there. They don&#8217;t see
much of anybody, and some of &#8217;em&#8217;s as timid
as deer. The children, now, run when they see
a stranger coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to get?&#8221; asked Bobby.
He had been long enough on the farm to know
that when one harnessed up a horse and wagon
there was usually something to be fetched or carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up to see if I can&#8217;t get a woman
to come down next week and help Mrs. Peter
do some cleaning,&#8221; explained Peter. &#8220;Help&#8217;s
scarce in the town, and some of the mountain-folk
like to earn a little money in the summer.
Miss Polly taking the buggy, I had to get along
with the market wagon. &#8217;Sides, the thought
came to me that I might meet some one who
wanted a ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg saw Peter&#8217;s eyes twinkling and she
guessed that he had meant to ask them to go with
him all the time.</p>
<p>Terry was going up a steep road now, narrow
as well as steep, and the untrimmed trees lashed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
against the curtained sides of the wagon as it
passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Mrs. Cook&#8217;s house,&#8221; said Peter at last.</p>
<p>The children saw a little unpainted house
standing in a clearing of half-chopped tree-stumps.
A line of washing was strung between
the two posts that supported a narrow roof over
the door. Skins of animals were tacked on the
sides of the house, and a large hound dog
chained to a tree watched them closely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we get out and see the dog?&#8221; asked Meg,
as Peter tied Terry to a convenient tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;d touch the dog,&#8221; said
Peter. &#8220;Better keep away from him. He&#8217;s a
night hunter, and may be cross. There&#8217;s Mrs.
Cook&#8217;s little girl&ndash;&ndash;go and make friends with her
If you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter went up to the house door and knocked,
and Meg walked over to a little girl seated on
a tree stump.</p>
<p>The child was barefooted and wore a ragged
dress, but her skin was a beautiful clear brown
and her eyes were as blue as Meg&#8217;s. She had
lovely long brown hair, too.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Meg.</p>
<p>Apparently the little girl had not heard her
coming, for she jumped when Meg spoke and
turned swiftly. Then she shrieked loudly and
dashed for the house. Peter came out at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you frightened her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
Christopher Columbus, I don&#8217;t wonder. You
look like a band of Indians let loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My! we forgot these clothes,&#8221; said Bobby.
&#8220;Meg didn&#8217;t mean to frighten her. Look at
Twaddles&ndash;&ndash;she scared him pretty near stiff yelling
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cook came out to the wagon presently,
to tell Peter that she would come the next week.
She was a little thin, brown-faced woman, and
she was even shyer than Dot, who usually shrank
out of sight when there were any strangers
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;These Miss Polly&#8217;s &#8217;lations?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Cook, twisting her apron nervously.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>LINDA IS UNHAPPY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Every one of &#8217;em,&#8221; announced Peter.
&#8220;These, ma&#8217;am, are the four little Blossoms!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t mean to scare your little girl,&#8221;
said Meg bravely. &#8220;I guess she thought we
were Indians. These are just play clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Emma Louise scares easy,&#8221; said Mrs. Cook.
&#8220;All my children do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many have you?&#8221; asked Twaddles,
meaning to be polite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine,&#8221; replied Mrs. Cook serenely. &#8220;Four
boys and five girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to be going, if we get back in time
for supper,&#8221; hinted Peter, gathering up the
reins. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell the Missus you&#8217;ll walk down
Tuesday morning, then, and I&#8217;ll drive you home
at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; begged Dot, as Peter was
about to turn Terry. It was the first word she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
had spoken since they had reached the Cook
house. &#8220;Give these to the little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the chain of gay-colored beads Dot
wore around her neck with the Indian dress, and
Mrs. Cook&#8217;s face wrinkled into a smile of delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emma Louise will love &#8217;em,&#8221; she declared
brightly. &#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot was too shy to say anything, but she
blushed and smiled and inwardly wished that
Peter would drive on. Soon they were going
down the mountain again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Polly&#8217;s at home!&#8221; shouted Dot, as they
turned into the drive and she saw a white figure
rocking in the porch swing.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly was very glad to see them, and she
had not been worried because Jud had told her
where the children had gone. The milking was
done, she said, and everything fed, so if they
would get washed and dressed right away for
supper, Linda would put it on the table while
they were upstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Linda looked as if she&#8217;d been crying,&#8221; said
Meg, slipping off the Indian dress and pulling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
on a clean white piqu&eacute;. &#8220;Her eyes were all
red.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she was bad and her mother scolded
her,&#8221; said Dot.</p>
<p>At the supper table Aunt Polly listened to the
story of the afternoon&#8217;s drive, and heard about
Mrs. Cook and the queer little house, but all
the time she seemed to be thinking of something
else. And there was certainly something seriously
wrong with Linda. She scarcely ate any
supper, and her eyes were red, as Meg said.
Twaddles was sure she had the toothache. When
he went out into the kitchen after supper he
found her crying over the dishes, and she was
cross to him and told him to get out of her
kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Linda has the measles,&#8221; reported the
astonished Twaddles to the rest of the family,
who were on the front porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess she&#8217;s sick,&#8221; remarked Bobby.
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t want any cold chicken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she bad, Aunt Polly?&#8221; questioned Dot
&#8220;Did her mother punish her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Linda and I had decided not to bother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
you with our troubles,&#8221; said Aunt Polly, &#8220;but
I see we can&#8217;t hide a thing from your sharp
eyes. I have bad news to tell you. While you
were away with Peter this afternoon, and while
Linda and I were in town, a miserable chicken
thief got into the chicken yard and stole ever so
many chickens. We don&#8217;t know yet how many.
And they took nearly every one of Linda&#8217;s
ducks. She has the ducks for her own, you
know, and she uses the money for her school
clothes. So that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms sat and stared at
Aunt Polly. They had completely forgotten
the chickens and ducks and the one lame turkey
shut into the tent till this minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Polly!&#8221; gasped Meg, in a very little
voice. &#8220;Aunt Polly&ndash;&ndash;please, we were just playing,
and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Meg could not go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were playing Indians,&#8221; said Bobby, coming
to the rescue of his sister, &#8220;and we had to
have some captives. So&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We took the chickens and the ducks,&#8221; went
on the twins in concert.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the lame turkey,&#8221; put in Meg.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And shut them in our tent!&#8221; finished Bobby
and Meg together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put them in your tent?&#8221; repeated Aunt Polly.
&#8220;Do you suppose they are there now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Away dashed the children, Aunt Polly after
them, around to the side lawn. The tent was
just as they had left it, and Meg cautiously unbuttoned
the flap. A soft, comfortable little
singing sound came out to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; said Aunt Polly helplessly.
&#8220;What won&#8217;t you children do next!&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms ran back to tell Linda
that her ducks were safe, and you may be sure
she was very glad to hear it. And in the morning
they found the biddies and the ducks none
the worse for their night in the tent.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Bobby and Meg were awakened
one night by a queer noise outside. Bobby
heard it first and came creeping into Meg&#8217;s
room to see if she were awake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg! Meg!&#8221; he whispered, so as not to wake
Dot. &#8220;Did you hear something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; whispered back Meg. &#8220;Under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
my window. Wait a minute and we&#8217;ll peep
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot and Twaddles wouldn&#8217;t wake up, &#8220;not if
there was an earthquake,&#8221; Daddy Blossom sometimes
said, but Meg and Bobby were light sleepers
and very apt to hear any unusual noise.</p>
<p>Together now they crept over to Meg&#8217;s window
and, raising the screen very softly, peeped
out. Something large and dark was moving
about on the lawn below.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s Mr. Simmonds&#8217; bull,&#8221; suggested
Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we ought to go down and
drive him off?&#8221; asked Bobby, quite as if driving
bulls off his aunt&#8217;s lawn was a nightly task with
him. &#8220;Or I&#8217;ll go alone&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m the man of the
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he was. Aunt Polly and
Linda slept in rooms across the hall at the back
of the house, and apparently had heard nothing.
But Meg had no idea of letting her brother face
a bull alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, too,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put
on our shoes&ndash;&ndash;you know how wet the grass is at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
night. And here&#8217;s a blanket, so you won&#8217;t catch
cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrapping herself in another blanket&ndash;&ndash;Aunt
Polly kept two light-weight blankets folded at
the foot of each bed for chilly nights&ndash;&ndash;Meg tiptoed
carefully downstairs after Bobby. They
knew their way about the house now, even in the
dark. The front door was not locked, for people
in the country seldom lock their doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bobby!&#8221; Meg called softly. &#8220;Look!
There&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em! See! All down the
drive! They can&#8217;t be Mr. Simmonds&#8217; bull&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not all of &#8217;em,&#8221; snickered Bobby.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one of him. Come on, Meg, I&#8217;m
going up to one and see what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a calf!&#8221; cried Meg, in astonishment.
&#8220;A darling baby calf! They all are!
How many are there, Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can count fourteen,&#8221; said Bobby after a moment,
for the night was not pitch black, but one
of those soft summer nights with so many stars
that after your eyes are accustomed to it you can
see objects distinctly enough to count.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s left their barnyard gate open,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
announced Meg. &#8220;What&#8217;ll we do? Drive &#8217;em
into our barnyard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; answered Bobby, just like a farmer.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll keep &#8217;em safe till morning. And then
Jud will find out whose they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Driving those fourteen baby calves was not
such hard work as they had expected, for they
were very amiable beasties and only wanted to
nibble a little fresh sweet grass as they were
driven on toward the barnyard. But Meg and
Bobby had so much fun doing this that they forgot
to be quiet, and just as they had the last calf
safely inside and the big gate barred, two figures
came running up to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of Pete!&#8221; said Jud, breathing
heavily. &#8220;Meg and Bobby! And in their
night clothes! Are you crazy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s fourteen baby calves in there,&#8221; announced
Bobby with dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and they would have had the whole
lawn eaten up if it hadn&#8217;t been for us,&#8221; declared
Meg.</p>
<p>Peter and Jud peered over the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are Tom Sparks&#8217; calves he bought for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
his auction next week,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;Guess he
didn&#8217;t pen &#8217;em in good to-night. Well, you
youngsters don&#8217;t miss anything, do you? You
run back to bed now, and in the morning we&#8217;ll
do a little telephoning.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when Jud came up while they were at
breakfast the next morning and told them that
Mr. Sparks wanted to pay a reward of five dollars
to the person who had saved his calves for
him, maybe there wasn&#8217;t great excitement!</p>
<p>Aunt Polly then heard the story for the first
time, as did Dot and Twaddles and Linda.</p>
<p>&#8220;You take it,&#8221; advised Linda, when Jud repeated
the offer of the reward. &#8220;If the constable
had put his calves in the pound it would
have cost him twice that to get them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t like to have them take money,&#8221;
protested Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jud suddenly. &#8220;Mr. Sparks
can pay them back some other way.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE PICNIC</h3>
</div>
<p>Jud went off whistling, and soon after they
had finished breakfast the four little Blossoms
saw a tall, stout man drive in. His horse
was a beautiful, shiny black animal, evidently
groomed and tended with great care.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Mr. Sparks,&#8221; Linda informed the
children.</p>
<p>The children ran out to see the calves being
herded together, and Jud embarrassed Meg and
Bobby very much by introducing them as the
little people who had heard the calves in the
night and gone downstairs after them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg heard &#8217;em,&#8221; said Bobby modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, well!&#8221; almost shouted Mr.
Sparks, though that was his natural way of talking;
he couldn&#8217;t speak low. &#8220;I do certainly admire
a girl with spunk enough to get up in the
middle of the night and chase live-stock. You
ought to be a farmer&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and smiled at the children. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
was impossible not to like this bluff, red-faced
man with the loud voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had intended to give a little reward to the
person who did me this service,&#8221; went on Mr.
Sparks. &#8220;Finding there&#8217;s two of &#8217;em, rightly I
should double it. But Mrs. Hayward, I hear,
doesn&#8217;t want you to take money&ndash;&ndash;good notion,
too, in a way, I guess. Suppose I give you one
of these little calves now. How would that
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those darling little calves?&#8221; cried
Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep?&#8221; echoed Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep, of course,&#8221; assented Mr. Sparks.
&#8220;You pick the critter you want, and I guess Mrs.
Hayward will pasture it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure she will,&#8221; promised Jud, who was standing
by with a delighted smile. &#8220;And after you
go back to Oak Hill, I&#8217;ll take good care of it
and next summer you can come up and see your
own cow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Polly and Linda and Peter all had to
be summoned, and then, with every one&#8217;s help
and advice, not forgetting the twins&#8217;, Bobby and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
Meg selected a handsome cream-colored little
calf that Mr. Sparks assured them would grow
into a Jersey bossy cow like Mrs. Sally Sweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you going to call her?&#8221; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>Bobby looked at Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;You name her,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Let&#8217;s call her Carlotta,&#8221; said
Meg promptly. &#8220;I think that is the loveliest
name.&#8221; So Carlotta the calf was named.</p>
<p>Carlotta did not seem to mind at all when her
friends and relatives were driven off by Mr.
Sparks. Apparently she liked Brookside farm
and was glad she was going to live there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much, Mr. Sparks,&#8221; said
Meg and Bobby for the twentieth time, as he
drove out of the gateway after his recovered
property.</p>
<p>A day or two after the finding of the calves
Aunt Polly came out on the porch where the
children were cutting up an old fashion magazine
for paper dolls, and sat down in the porch
swing with her mending basket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, honeys,&#8221; she began, &#8220;if we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
don&#8217;t have our picnic pretty soon, vacation is going
to be over. Though what I am to do this
long cold winter without any children in my
house I don&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby and I have to go to school,&#8221; said Meg.
&#8220;But Dot and Twaddles could stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to school, too,&#8221; declared Dot,
with such a positive snap of her blunt scissors
that she snipped off a paper doll&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; affirmed Twaddles, with maddening
serenity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think we&#8217;d better talk about the picnic,&#8221;
interposed Aunt Polly. &#8220;When to have it,
and whom to invite and what to have to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandwiches!&#8221; cried Meg, answering the last
question first. &#8220;Let me help make &#8217;em,
Auntie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; promised Aunt Polly. &#8220;And
it seems to me that we had better go to-morrow.
This spell of fine dry weather can&#8217;t last forever,
and when the rain does come we may have a week
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can Jud come?&#8221; asked Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; answered Aunt Polly, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
the happiest way of saying &#8220;yes&#8221; to nearly everything
her nephews and nieces asked of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Linda?&#8221; asked Twaddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Linda, too,&#8221; agreed Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;ll we go?&#8221; demanded the practical
Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over in the woods,&#8221; said Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get ready,&#8221; proposed Meg, who knew
a picnic meant work beforehand.</p>
<p>Every one scattered, Meg and Aunt Polly to
the kitchen to help Linda pack the lunch boxes,
as far as they could be packed the day before the
picnic; Bobby to tell Jud that he was expected;
and Dot and Twaddles on an errand of their
own.</p>
<p>They were gone some time, and when they
returned acted so mysteriously that Meg was
quite out of patience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure you have enough sandwiches,&#8221; advised
Twaddles, swinging on the kitchen screen
door, a thing which always made Linda nervous.</p>
<p>&#8220;There might somebody come at the last minute,&#8221;
chimed in Dot.</p>
<p>Then she and Twaddles giggled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Those silly children,&#8221; said Meg with her
most grown-up air. &#8220;I suppose they think they
sound funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot and Twaddles apparently did not care
how they sounded, and they stayed in the kitchen,
stirring and tasting, till Linda flatly declared
that she&#8217;d put pepper in the pressed chicken instead
of salt if they didn&#8217;t stop bothering her.
Jud came just at that moment and asked the
twins to help him see if the new catch on the
chicken yard gate worked all right, and the two
little torments readily followed him.</p>
<p>Nearly everything was ready for the picnic
by that night, and every one went to bed hoping
for a clear day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun is shining, Meg! Meg, get up!&#8221;
shouted Dot early the next morning. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going on a picnic!&#8221;</p>
<p>She made so much noise that she woke up
Aunt Polly and Linda, as well as Bobby and
Twaddles, and then, of course, there was nothing
to do but to get up and have breakfast.</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms found Peter and Jud
busy in the barn, putting clean straw in the bottom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
of the box wagon that was used to haul logs
and brushwood in in the winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be ready in two jerks of a lamb&#8217;s tail,&#8221; announced
Peter, using one of his favorite expressions.</p>
<p>When the heavy wagon rattled up to the front
door, the four little Blossoms were already sitting
on the straw. Aunt Polly and Linda were
helped in by Jud, who also lifted in the boxes
of lunch, and then Peter clucked to Jerry and
Terry, and away they went, over the meadow
into the woods, and up the narrow wagon road.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, isn&#8217;t this pretty?&#8221; asked Aunt Polly, as
the road suddenly came out into a clearing, and
they saw the brook a bit ahead of them.</p>
<p>They all jumped out, and Peter turned the
horses&#8217; heads toward home at once. He was
anxious to get back to his work, but was coming
for them at half-past four.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get some flowers for the table,&#8221;
said Aunt Polly, after she had helped Linda put
the boxes in a low branch of a tree where nothing
could touch them. &#8220;Come, children, let&#8217;s
get a bouquet of flowers.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>They gathered wild flowers, and also found
some late blackberries which, placed on a wide
green leaf as a dish, looked very pretty. Linda
spread a white cloth presently, and was opening
the boxes when the sound of a rattling wagon
attracted her attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that doesn&#8217;t sound like Mr. Sparks&#8217; old
rig,&#8221; said Linda curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; announced Dot complacently. &#8220;Twaddles
and me asked him to come to the picnic,
&#8217;cause he gave Meg and Bobby the calf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Aunt Polly murmured helplessly,
&#8220;what will those children do next!&#8221; they were
all very glad to see Mr. Sparks when he finally
rattled up. And there was plenty of everything
to eat&ndash;&ndash;trust Aunt Polly and Linda for that.</p>
<p>Mr. Sparks brought a freezer of ice-cream
with him, which his wife had made, as his contribution
to the picnic, and though he had to go
as soon as lunch was over, he assured the children
that he had had a splendid time.</p>
<p>When the crumbs were all scattered for the
birds, and the papers and boxes neatly buried,
except one box of sandwiches they had not eaten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
and which they saved for Peter, Aunt Polly declared
that she wanted to sit quietly for an hour
and knit. Linda, too, had her embroidery, but
the four little Blossoms wanted to go wading.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll watch &#8217;em,&#8221; promised Jud.</p>
<p>So Meg and Bobby and Dot and Twaddles
took off their shoes and stockings and pattered
over the pine needles that covered the grass
down to the edge of the brook.</p>
<p>Bobby dipped one foot in to test the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s cold!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just like ice,
Jud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t mind it after you&#8217;ve been in a little
while,&#8221; Jud assured him. &#8220;Now when I say
come out, you&#8217;re to come. No teasing to stay
in! Is that agreed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; promised the four little Blossoms.
&#8220;Oh, ow! isn&#8217;t it cold?&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XV_WHAT_MEG_FOUND' id='CHAPTER_XV_WHAT_MEG_FOUND'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>WHAT MEG FOUND</h3>
</div>
<p>The first thing Dot did was to step in a deep
hole and get her dress and tucked-up skirt
wet nearly to her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Meg calmly. &#8220;Aunt
Polly brought some dry things with her. I
guess she expected Dot to go in bathing instead
of wading.&#8221;</p>
<p>This made Dot very indignant, but she pattered
along after the others, and in a few minutes
forgot to be cross. When you are wading
in a clear, cold brook with little dancing leaves
making checkered patterns on the water, and a
green forest all around you, you can not stay
cross long.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see something,&#8221; said Bobby suddenly.
&#8220;Look! Over there where it&#8217;s wide! Don&#8217;t
you see it, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like clothes,&#8221; said Meg, shading her
eyes with her hand, for the sun on the water dazzled
her. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a wash. Aunt Polly said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
some of the hired men around here wash their
clothes in the brook. Let&#8217;s go and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, here! Where are you going?&#8221; called
Jud, as they began to scramble down.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw something on the other side of the
brook,&#8221; explained Bobby. &#8220;We&#8217;re going over
to see what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you just wait,&#8221; ordered Jud. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the widest part of the brook down there, and all
that side is swampy land. You can&#8217;t land on it.
You&#8217;ll sink in. Wait till I take my shoes off, and
I&#8217;ll come and help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud took off his shoes and socks and rolled his
trousers up to his knees. He wasn&#8217;t afraid that
the four little Blossoms would drown, for the
brook was not very deep in any part. But it
was wide at the point where Bobby wanted to
cross, and there was no bank, only a piece of
swamp, on the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll take Dot and Twaddles, and you
and Meg hold hands,&#8221; said Jud, as he stepped
into the water. &#8220;Come on, Pirates, let&#8217;s board
yonder frigate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children giggled and stepped gingerly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
after Jud. They were glad he had come with
them, for the mild little brook looked like a
river to them as they got out into the middle
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose that is over there?&#8221;
said Bobby. &#8220;I wish it was buried treasure. I
never found any buried treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is Indians,&#8221; Meg suggested a little
fearfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a flag of truce?&#8221; said Jud, understanding
at once. &#8220;Well, Meg, I don&#8217;t believe we
have any Indians around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a dive for Dot and saved her from
slipping, but she wasn&#8217;t a bit grateful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost caught a crab,&#8221; she sputtered.</p>
<p>Before Bobby could tell her that crabs didn&#8217;t
live in brooks, they had reached the piece of
swamp land and all four children rushed for the
fluttering bit of white which had attracted
Bobby&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a shirt!&#8221; said Twaddles in great disappointment.</p>
<p>Whatever he had expected to see, it certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
wasn&#8217;t a shirt and he felt cheated. Jud had to
laugh at the queer expression on his face.</p>
<p>Meg, however, did not laugh. She was eyeing
the shirt closely and Jud saw that she had something
on her mind. Perhaps Meg was his favorite
among the children, if he had a favorite.
He had once told Linda that Meg was a &#8220;regular
little woman&#8221; and indeed, quiet as she was, she
often saw things that other people did not notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jud,&#8221; she said now, &#8220;that shirt hasn&#8217;t any
buttons on it and the pocket is ripped. And
Linda brought her sewing basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby looked at his little sister as though he
thought she was losing her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a sewing basket got to do with it?&#8221;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It needs mending,&#8221; said Meg soberly. &#8220;Maybe
the man who washed it hasn&#8217;t any needle and
thread.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins declared that everyone had needle
and thread, but Jud rather spoiled their argument
by announcing that he had none.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t sew, so what good would needle and
thread do me?&#8221; he asked them.</p>
<p>Meg, forgetting the shirt for a moment, asked
him what he did when buttons came off his
clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother sews them on again,&#8221; said Jud,
&#8220;and Mother darns my socks and Mother mends
the rips I get in my coats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you see!&#8221; Meg cried triumphantly.
&#8220;This man hasn&#8217;t any mother to sew buttons on
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On his shirt, you mean,&#8221; giggled Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe he hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Bobby admitted. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t suppose he has, or he wouldn&#8217;t have to do
his own washing. But Linda&#8217;s basket is on the
other side of the brook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take the shirt over to her and
ask her to mend it,&#8221; announced Meg. &#8220;I know
she will. Then I&#8217;ll bring it back and hang it
on the bush and won&#8217;t he be surprised!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be more surprised if he comes along
and his shirt is missing,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Why,
he&#8217;ll think the birds made way with it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>This was a new problem for Meg and she
thought about it for several minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot and Twaddles can stay here,&#8221; she decided,
&#8220;and if the man comes, they can tell him
that I will bring his shirt back as soon as it is
mended.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the twins did not take kindly to the idea
of being left alone. They said they were going
back when Jud went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you take the shirt, and I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; said
Meg, who seldom gave up a plan, once she had
made it. &#8220;Please ask Linda to put the buttons
on and mend the pocket and then you bring it
right back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud looked doubtful at the thought of leaving
Meg, even when Bobby declared he would stay
with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to go, for the children can&#8217;t get back
alone,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you mustn&#8217;t go away from
here: I want to be able to find you when I
bring the laundry home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby and Meg laughed and promised to
stay close to the bush. Meg folded up the shirt
and stuffed it in Jud&#8217;s pocket, because she said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Dot would drop it in the water if she tried to
carry it and Twaddles would want to play with
it and might get it dirty. Then Meg and Bobby
watched the three wade back and when they
reached the opposite bank, they waved to them.</p>
<p>Though Jud had said they could not land,
there was a narrow strip of ground firm enough
to hold them and it was on this the bush grew
where the unknown man had hung his washing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any house for him to live in,&#8221;
said Bobby curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he lives in a tent,&#8221; Meg answered
absently, trying to see across the brook to the
tree where she knew Linda was sitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s walk down a little way,&#8221; suggested
Bobby. &#8220;We&#8217;ll come right back: Jud didn&#8217;t say
we couldn&#8217;t go wading. He only said to be
here when he came. Maybe we&#8217;ll find the man&#8217;s
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was willing enough, for she was no more
fond of sitting still than Bobby was. Holding
hands, they began cautiously to wade down
stream.</p>
<p>The water rushed more swiftly than they actually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
liked, but neither would say so. Instead
they slipped over the stones and tried to walk
as fast as the water, and presently Meg had to
stop to get her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear a kitty crying,&#8221; she said the next minute.
&#8220;Listen, Bobby&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you hear a cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>But as noises often do, as soon as Bobby
listened intently, the noise stopped. He couldn&#8217;t
hear a thing and said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! Now don&#8217;t you hear it?&#8221; cried Meg.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a little kitty and it must be lost. Oh,
Bobby, we have to find it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby could hear the kitten mewing now and
he was as eager to find it as Meg was. But how
could a kitten be in the brook?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s back there!&#8221; Meg said, waving her hand
toward the marshy land. &#8220;Maybe, if we call it,
it will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>And together they called, &#8220;Kitty! Kitty!
Kitty!&#8221; but the little faint &#8220;Meow&#8221; sounded just
the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to hunt for it,&#8221; declared
Bobby, looking at the wet and soggy ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
rather regretfully. &#8220;I hope there aren&#8217;t any
snakes in there,&#8221; he added gloomily.</p>
<p>Meg had a horror of snakes and she didn&#8217;t
want her dearly loved brother to go where they
might be. Neither could she go away and leave
the kitten. So, like the brave and affectionate
little girl she was, she said she was going with
Bobby.</p>
<p>They hoped with all their hearts they wouldn&#8217;t
see a snake and they didn&#8217;t know what they
would do if they did, but they had no intention
of leaving that forlorn kitty cat to its own fate.
And, as sometimes happens, it turned out that
they did not have to go where they dreaded to
go at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it!&#8221; cried Meg suddenly, her sharp
eyes having searched the bank near them, where
it jutted out into the water. &#8220;Look, Bobby, in
that crooked tree, hanging out over the brook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby looked. At the very tip end of the
longest branch, there clung a tiny ball of dirty
white which must be the kitten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scared to death,&#8221; commented Bobby. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how we can get it down: the more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
I shake the tree, the harder it will dig its claws
in. That&#8217;s the way cats do.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Meg was ready with a plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You climb up the tree,&#8221; she told Bobby, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll stand underneath and hold my skirts out;
you can pull the cat off and drop it down into
my lap.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was easier said than done, as they both
discovered the next minute. For one thing, the
water sucked past the tree in a current that
forced Meg to brace her feet wide apart to keep
her balance. And when Bobby had climbed
the tree, he found the limb wasn&#8217;t strong enough
to bear his weight and he couldn&#8217;t crawl out
to the cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had a pole, I could push her off,&#8221; he
shouted to Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bend it down,&#8221; she called. &#8220;Bend the branch
down and I&#8217;ll pick her off, Bobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, after one or two unsuccessful attempts
to bend the branch down, that was just what
they did do. Bobby managed to bend it within
arm&#8217;s reach of Meg, who detached the little cat
much as you pick a caterpillar off a leaf. Though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
the cat stuck tighter to the branch than any
caterpillar was ever known to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right,&#8221; said Meg soothingly, putting
the kitten in her dress and gathering it up
like a bag. &#8220;Soon as you get home, you can
have something to eat and you&#8217;ll feel much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hard work, wading against the current,
but they helped each other and by good luck
reached the bush, just as they saw Jud starting
out from the other side. Dot and Twaddles
danced impatiently on the bank, but he had
evidently told them to stay there, for they did
not follow him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jud! Jud!&#8221; called Bobby and Meg, beginning
to do a dance of their own. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
know what we found, Jud!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was you, I&#8217;d wait to do my prancing
on, dry ground,&#8221; Jud advised them as he waded
across. &#8220;It&#8217;s safer and drier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Linda do the shirt? Is it mended?&#8221;
Meg asked eagerly, when Jud was within easy
talking distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mended tip-top,&#8221; announced Jud. &#8220;Buttons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
all on, pocket sewed back, rip between the shoulders
all fixed. Never saw a neater job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Linda is good as she can be,&#8221; Meg said
gratefully, holding her skirts with one hand
and reaching for the shirt with the other. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
spread it out just the way we found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They draped the shirt as Meg insisted she
remembered seeing it, Jud all the while staring
curiously at the little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you holding in your skirt?&#8221; he
asked when she gave him her free hand and they
were ready to cross the brook.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a surprise,&#8221; Meg said mysteriously. &#8220;I
want to surprise Dot and Twaddles. You&#8217;ll
never be able to guess what it is, either, Jud.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just as she said that, her foot slipped.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE NEW CAT</h3>
</div>
<p>Meg could not fall flat, for Jud had hold
of her hand, but she did drop her carefully
held skirt. There was a splash, a startled
&#8220;Meow!&#8221; and a shriek from Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it drown!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Jud, catch
it, quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>If Meg had planned to surprise the twins,
she could not have managed better. They
couldn&#8217;t quite see what was going on, but they
knew that something had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they called. &#8220;Can we come
in, Jud, can&#8217;t we come see?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud made a quick scoop with his hand and
brought out the miserable, clawing, spitting little
kitten.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay where you are!&#8221; he ordered the
twins. &#8220;Say, where&#8217;ll I put this?&#8221; he asked
helplessly, turning to Meg.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>She held up her skirt again and he dropped
the kitten in it, since that seemed to be the only
place, and as Meg afterward said she was &#8220;a
little damp&#8221; from the cat&#8217;s splash and more
water wouldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>Then Jud took hold of Meg&#8217;s hand more
firmly and Bobby&#8217;s, too, and they managed to
reach the opposite bank without any more mishaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What is it?&#8221; Dot and Twaddles
begged, running up and down madly. &#8220;Did you
find something, Meg? Did you see the buttons
on the shirt? Did the man come and ask you
who took it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t see anybody,&#8221; said Bobby, who
felt it was his duty to answer this flood of questions.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the man lives very near,
because we didn&#8217;t see any house. But Meg
found something.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time Aunt Polly and Linda had come
down to the brook, to see what was making the
twins more excited than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meg found something!&#8221; Dot told Aunt
Polly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Did you, dear?&#8221; asked Aunt Polly, smiling.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me it is another shirt, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg stepped back and faced the group dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cat!&#8221; she said, and held her &#8220;find&#8221; up
for them to see.</p>
<p>To her amazement, Linda and Jud went off
into fits of laughter and even Aunt Polly seemed
to be trying not to smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything funny,&#8221; Meg announced
stiffly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a poor little almost dead cat. Bobby
and I found it down the brook, hanging on a
tree and afraid to climb off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the poor little thing!&#8221; said Aunt Polly
with ready sympathy. &#8220;We must take it home
and feed it, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only laughing,&#8221; Linda explained, wiping
her eyes, &#8220;because it is such a distressed-looking
cat, Meg. It&#8217;s so dirty and so little and so&ndash;&ndash;so
mad!&#8221; she finished as the cat humped up its
back and spit at Twaddles who tried to stroke it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stray kittens don&#8217;t make friends very readily,&#8221;
said kind Aunt Polly. &#8220;They think everyone
is their enemy, till proved otherwise. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
must teach your kitten, Meg, that at Brookside
Farm we like kitty cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose it came from?&#8221; Bobby
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, some one had more cats than they wanted,
so they turned it loose, down by the brook,&#8221; said
Jud. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mean trick and if I ever caught a
person doing it, I wouldn&#8217;t waste a second giving
him a piece of my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg stared at the forlorn white kitten gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose it belongs to the man who
washed the shirt, do you?&#8221; she suggested
earnestly.</p>
<p>Linda laughed. She was busily wrapping up
the cat in tissue paper&ndash;&ndash;of all things!&ndash;&ndash;because
she happened to have a big wad of it in her
basket.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she said, handing the astonished kitten
to Meg. &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to have dirty things
around me&ndash;&ndash;you carry her like that and as soon
as we get home I&#8217;ll wash her. If the cat did
belong to the man whose shirt I mended, I
suppose you&#8217;d feel like going back and cutting
the buttons off, eh, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>Meg blushed a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o, I wouldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; she replied slowly,
&#8220;but next time I wouldn&#8217;t bother.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Jud said that he didn&#8217;t think a man
who had to wash his clothes in the brook and
dry them on a bush had any cats.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to call your find, Meg?&#8221;
asked Jud when they were riding home at half-past
four, Peter eating his sandwiches gratefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shirt,&#8221; Meg answered placidly. &#8220;What are
you laughing at? It&#8217;s white, like the shirt we
found, and if it hadn&#8217;t been for the shirt we
wouldn&#8217;t have found the kitten at all and it
might have fallen into the water and been
drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in spite of some teasing and much joking,
Meg continued to call the stray kitten
&#8220;Shirt.&#8221; True to her word, Linda washed the
little creature and when its fur dried it proved
to be very pretty, soft and silky. The kitty had
blue eyes and by the time it was a full-grown
cat, Aunt Polly was immensely proud of it.</p>
<p>For Shirt lived at Brookside Farm and did
not go with the four little Blossoms when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
went home to Oak Hill. Aunt Polly said Poots
would miss him and that cats didn&#8217;t like to
change their homes, anyway, and Meg knew this
to be true. And every year, at Christmas time,
Meg remembered to send Shirt a Christmas
present and when she came to visit Aunt Polly,
he always seemed to know her.</p>
<p>The week of rain which Aunt Polly had predicted
and which had led her to hasten the picnic,
arrived two or three days after the adventure
in the brook. The exceedingly practical Meg
remarked at the breakfast table, the first rainy
morning, that she didn&#8217;t care if it did rain&ndash;&ndash;Shirt
was safe in a dry place and the man had
had plenty of time to get his wash dry and take it
in off the bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what he said when he saw the buttons,&#8221;
speculated Dot.</p>
<p>But this was one question that never received
an answer, for the children never saw the man
who owned the shirt and they never heard
whether he was pleased to find his mending done
or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he thought the birds did it for him,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
said Twaddles helpfully and was delighted when
Jud told him that there was a bird called the
tailor bird.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he did it,&#8221; Twaddles declared, and
when Dot pointed out that they had seen Linda
doing the work, Twaddles explained that he
meant the man would think the tailor bird had
done it.</p>
<p>It was talk like this between the twins that
made Jud say it gave him a headache if he
listened too long.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had a rain like this in a long
time,&#8221; said Aunt Polly, glancing out of the dining-room
window at the dripping leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since we lost the raft,&#8221; Bobby reminded
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we&#8217;ll ever find that,&#8221; said Meg
for the fortieth time.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you,&#8221; Aunt Polly announced
briskly, &#8220;I&#8217;d think up the nicest thing to do for a
rainy day and have just as much fun as I
could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go out in the barn,&#8221; suggested Twaddles.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We could see what Jud is doing,&#8221; Dot chimed
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mending the corn shelter,&#8221; said Bobby,
who usually knew what was going on at the
farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be fun to play lighthouse
in the barn and take our lunch and stay all day,&#8221;
Meg declared, having thought of this while the
others were talking.</p>
<p>None of them knew what the lighthouse game
might be, but it sounded new and exciting. Aunt
Polly said she didn&#8217;t see why they couldn&#8217;t have
a picnic in the barn as well as outdoors and she
promised to help Linda put up a lunch for
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only remember not to bother Jud, if he is
busy,&#8221; she cautioned them.</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms knew how to run &#8220;between
the drops&#8221; and as soon as their lunch was
packed, they kissed Aunt Polly and started for
the barn at breakneck speed. Flushed and
breathless and hardly wet at all, they burst into
the barn and told Jud, who was busy on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
main floor, that they were going to have another
picnic.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do manage to have a good time, all
right,&#8221; he said approvingly. &#8220;Where are you
going to play?&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked at Meg. It was her game and
she was the only one who knew the best place
to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to play in the loft,&#8221; directed Meg.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to live in a lighthouse, Jud, and
pull things up and down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud did not understand at first and when she
told him, he said that lighthouse keepers did not
live at the top of the lighthouse and pull things
up, but instead they lived in a neat little house
built on the ground, like other houses, and
climbed the tall stairs to take care of the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think it would be more fun to live
up high,&#8221; said Meg, and Jud said that was the
best of a &#8220;pretend&#8221; play. You could do it to
suit yourself.</p>
<p>The four children scrambled up the loft ladder&ndash;&ndash;practice
had made this once difficult feat
easy for them&ndash;&ndash;and for a half hour jumped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
about in the clean, sweet hay, forgetting their
game. The smooth, slippery hay, piled in such
masses, never failed to fascinate them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s play lighthouse,&#8221; suggested Meg,
when Twaddles had come down rather hard on
his nose and was trying not to cry. &#8220;First thing
we need is a basket and rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found a basket Jud said they might take
and he got a piece of rope for them. Then they
argued about staying down on the floor of the
barn to put things in the basket for, of course,
each one wanted to pull the basket up; that was
the interesting part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take turns,&#8221; Bobby advised. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay down
first, and let Meg pull up first, because she
thought of this game.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Meg ran up the ladder and Bobby put in
the lunch box and she pulled and tugged and
at last succeeded in pulling the basket up to
the loft.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>RAINY DAY FUN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bury it in the hay, before Twaddles
comes up,&#8221; said Meg to herself. &#8220;He always
wants to eat everything up right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>She peeped over the edge of the haymow and
saw the twins, one on either side of Bobby, staring
up. They looked funny, for their mouths
were open and Meg giggled a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send the basket back,&#8221; Twaddles called.
&#8220;We want to put something in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&ndash;&ndash;wait a minute,&#8221; answered Meg.</p>
<p>She ran back and hastily stuffed the lunch box
under the hay, pulling a pile over it so that it
did not show at all. Then she rushed to the
edge of the mow, but she was in such haste not
to keep the others waiting that she dropped the
basket, rope and all.</p>
<p>It rapped Dot on the head and she looked
astonished.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you threw it at me,&#8221; she
said resentfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Meg explained. &#8220;I forgot to hold
the rope. Shall I come down and get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twaddles will bring you the rope,&#8221; said
Bobby. &#8220;Soon as I put something in the basket.
Let&#8217;s see, what shall we put in next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Poots,&#8221; Dot suggested, pointing to
the cat who had followed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;ll like it,&#8221; objected Meg,
but Bobby was eager to send the cat aloft and
he and Twaddles together managed to stuff her
in the basket.</p>
<p>Bobby held her there while Twaddles took
one end of the rope in his hand and scrambled
up the ladder to the waiting Meg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you put the lunch?&#8221; he asked as
soon as he reached the loft.</p>
<p>&#8220;I put it away,&#8221; Meg assured him. &#8220;Are you
going to help me pull the basket up, Twaddles?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twaddles was eager to help and he forgot
the lunch. He stood back of Meg and they
both began to pull. Poots meowed sadly as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
she felt herself rising and Bobby and Dot
shouted to the pullers to &#8220;hurry up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poots will jump out in a minute,&#8221; warned
Bobby.</p>
<p>Twaddles&#8217; foot slipped on the soft hay and he
went down, slackening his hold on the rope as
he fell. Meg turned to see what had happened
to him, let the rope sag, and the basket fell a
foot or two with sickening speed.</p>
<p>This was too much for any self-respecting cat
and with a wild snarl Poots leaped clear over
the heads of Bobby and Dot. The angry cat
landed on his feet on the barn floor ten feet
away, and dashed out into the rain. Getting his
fur coat soaking wet was preferable to being
hoisted about in a basket, he seemed to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do to Poots?&#8221; called Jud.
&#8220;When he went out of that door, his tail was
two feet around!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were only playing with him,&#8221; Bobby
said. &#8220;But maybe he didn&#8217;t like it much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have time to play with the cat, you
have time to help me,&#8221; declared Jud. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
you and Meg want to come and help me see
if this sheller is going to work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby and Meg loved to help Jud and they
left their game cheerfully, to go to the corncrib.
It was attached to the other end of the barn, so
they didn&#8217;t have to go out in the rain. Jud
wanted to watch the machinery he had mended
and he asked Meg to turn the crank and Bobby
to feed in the ears of corn. They were never
allowed to touch the sheller unless some older
person was around, for little fingers could get
easily nipped in the cog wheels. So they were
rather proud to be especially asked to help Jud
make it work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought the twins were coming,&#8221; said Jud,
absently, bending down to tighten a screw.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have stayed to play with the basket,&#8221;
Meg replied.</p>
<p>And that was just what the twins were doing,
playing with the basket.</p>
<p>&#8220;You put something in it and let me pull it
up,&#8221; commanded Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything to put in it,&#8221; Twaddles
offered. &#8220;The cat&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well you don&#8217;t have to have a cat,&#8221; said Dot
impatiently. &#8220;I know what we can get&ndash;&ndash;eggs!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were always two or three hens that
persisted in stealing their nests and the twins
had a fair idea of where these stolen nests were
in the barn. They often found the eggs and
took them in to Linda.</p>
<p>Now, after a few minutes&#8217; search, they found
seven eggs and put them in the basket with
great glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me pull it up after you do?&#8221; asked Twaddles
as Dot climbed up the ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;perhaps,&#8221; she replied carefully. &#8220;I
might want to pull it up more than once myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She began to pull on the rope and the basket
dangled in the air. Whether the sound of voices
made Dot nervous, or whether the basket was
heavier than she had expected, it is hard to say.
But just as Jud and Bobby and Meg came out
on the barn floor, Dot let that basket fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good grief!&#8221; exclaimed Jud.</p>
<p>Twaddles seemed glued to one spot and the
basket crashed down almost under his nose. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
eggs broke and some splashed up and sprayed
him, but most of the contents ran out on the
floor in a bright yellow stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;You took eggs!&#8221; Meg said accusingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, nobody said not to,&#8221; answered Dot in
a rather frightened voice, peering over the edge
of the loft.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll say it now,&#8221; Jud proclaimed.
&#8220;After this, it is against the rules to put anything
in the basket which will break. Remember
that. And now, let me see if I can wipe you
off, Twaddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud found a cloth and mopped the egg off
Twaddles&ndash;&ndash;fortunately not much had reached
him&ndash;&ndash;and then Dot suggested that they do something
else.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could eat,&#8221; Twaddles said placidly,
which made Jud laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to start feeding the stock, so perhaps
it isn&#8217;t too early for you to have lunch,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;That is one sure way to keep the
twins quiet, Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot called after him that she hadn&#8217;t said anything
about eating, but Jud didn&#8217;t hear her. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
was already measuring out corn for the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the lunch?&#8221; asked Bobby, who began
to feel hungry himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; Meg replied, and ran
up the ladder.</p>
<p>She felt around in the hay where she had
buried the box, but she couldn&#8217;t find it. The
other children came up and watched her curiously,
but still she couldn&#8217;t feel anything like
a box.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you looking for?&#8221; said Dot curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;For our lunch,&#8221; Meg told her, almost ready
to cry. &#8220;I put it under the hay and now I can&#8217;t
find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby and the twins hastily got down beside
her and tossed the hay around. They looked
where Meg said she put the box and they looked
where she was sure it couldn&#8217;t be, but all that
happened was that they got very warm and tired
indeed and not one sign of the lunch did they
uncover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I think?&#8221; said Twaddles
wisely. &#8220;I think some rat found it and ate it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
I&#8217;ve seen rats up here in the loft, lots of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg glanced around hastily. She wasn&#8217;t at
all anxious to see a rat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rats couldn&#8217;t eat the box and everything in
it,&#8221; Bobby argued. &#8220;They would leave pieces
of paper and things that we would see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where is the box?&#8221; demanded Dot.</p>
<p>Bobby sat down to think and Meg waited respectfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get a pitchfork and turn over
all the hay,&#8221; Bobby decided. &#8220;That&#8217;s the only
way to find the box: it&#8217;s lost in all this hay.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was willing to go and get the pitchfork,
but he was gone several minutes. When he came
back, Jud was with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pitchforks and Twaddles won&#8217;t mix,&#8221; declared
Jud firmly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to manage some
other way. Show me where you hid the box,
Meg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg showed him, as nearly as she could remember.
Jud knelt down and felt under the
hay, while the children stared at him as though
they expected him to work some kind of magic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can find it,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
all sit down and close your eyes tightly and
don&#8217;t open them till I give the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they sat down on the floor and Dot put
her head in Meg&#8217;s lap, for it was hard for her
to keep her eyes closed. She always wanted
to see what was going on.</p>
<p>Meg counted to ninety-eight before she heard
Jud cry, &#8220;All right!&#8221;</p>
<p>The four little Blossoms opened their eyes
and there stood Jud, the lunch box in his hand.
He was smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you find it?&#8221; asked Meg. &#8220;Was
it under the hay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On top,&#8221; said Jud mysteriously. &#8220;You see,
Meg, the box fell through the slats and landed
on top of a ration of hay in one of the stalls.
All I had to do was to go downstairs and get
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Linda had packed the box so neatly and so
firmly that nothing was damaged and the children
had a delightful picnic up in the loft. They
played there most of the afternoon, too, and
often during the rainy days that followed. Indeed
they amused themselves so well and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
so little trouble to Aunt Polly, that she promised
them one more outdoor picnic, the first dry sunny
day that came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure you save me some sandwiches,&#8221; said
Peter, when he heard about it.</p>
<p>They promised and it was Dot who woke up
the household bright and early when she saw
the sun streaming in at the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can have the picnic!&#8221; she shouted joyfully.
&#8220;Aunt Polly, isn&#8217;t it dry and sunny? Get
up, Twaddles, we can have the picnic.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a sunny day, but it wasn&#8217;t so dry, for
the ground was still damp from so much rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we go wading, the water&#8217;s wet,&#8221; argued
Dot, and Linda, too, thought they might as well
go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget my sandwiches,&#8221; Peter reminded
them as he saw them start.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE END OF THE VACATION</h3>
</div>
<p>The four little Blossoms wanted to go to
the same place where they had gone before
and Jud drove them. Then he was to take the
horses and wagon back for his father to use
during the day and Peter would come for the
picnickers in the afternoon and get his sandwiches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go wading till Jud comes,&#8221; said Aunt
Polly, when good-natured Jud had gone back.
&#8220;Help Linda spread out the rubber blanket, for
we want to be comfortable while you play
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children spread out the blanket and on
top of that Aunt Polly spread a cotton one and
then she and Linda sat down to sew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go see if there is another shirt spread
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
out to dry,&#8221; suggested Meg, and she was much
excited when they saw a bit of white fluttering
from a bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t the same place,&#8221; Dot argued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s almost the same place,&#8221; retorted
Bobby. &#8220;Only it looks ragged,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Meg was eager to go and examine the white
thing, but she knew they would have to wait
for Jud. Aunt Polly laughed when she heard
about it and said that Meg would have Linda
running a mending shop if she was not very
careful.</p>
<p>&#8220;After we have lunch, if Jud is willing to
take you, you may go over and see what it is,&#8221;
she told her little niece kindly. &#8220;You&#8217;d have
every one nicely washed and mended if you
could, wouldn&#8217;t you, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud came back on foot and after he had rested
a minute, declared he was willing to wade the
brook with the children. But Aunt Polly insisted
they must have lunch first and of course
no one wanted to miss that. As soon as the last
crumb was gone, however, the children began
to tease and Jud said they might as well go. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
had laughed at the idea of another shirt, but
half way across the stream he seemed to change
his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess somebody lost his shirt,&#8221; observed Jud,
keeping a firm grip on Dot, who seemed to be
trying to dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, wouldn&#8217;t it be funny,&#8221; began Bobby, but
Meg had the same idea at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose it could&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she said
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the raft!&#8221; yelled Twaddles, breaking
away from Jud, and rushing into the bushes.
&#8220;It&#8217;s our raft&ndash;&ndash;Oh, Jud!&#8221; Twaddles had
stepped on a sharp stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d be a little more careful,&#8221; said
Jud calmly. &#8220;Well, it is the raft! Can you
beat that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tangled in broken reeds and a few prickly
bushes, lay their raft, Geraldine smiling as
sweetly as ever and still propped up against
Meg&#8217;s book. Nothing was missing, not even
Twaddles&#8217; singing bird or Bobby&#8217;s airplane.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; Meg kept saying. &#8220;I&#8217;m so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
glad! Now let&#8217;s go home and play with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky we&#8217;ve had this long, dry spell,&#8221;
said Jud, picking up Geraldine and eyeing her
critically. &#8220;If we&#8217;d had one good storm, good-by
toys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot tucked Geraldine under her arm, Twaddles
stuffed his bird into his pocket, Meg took
her book and Bobby his airplane, and Jud offered
to tow the raft. So slowly and carefully
they made their way back to where Jud had left
his socks and shoes.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly and Linda were surprised and delighted
when they saw the children coming, for
they had begun to wonder what they could be
doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me you found the
raft!&#8221; exclaimed Aunt Polly, when she heard the
news. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s the best luck I ever heard
of.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Linda said &#8220;My goodness!&#8221; over and
over, and wanted to know just where they had
found it and who saw it first and how they had
managed to reach it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve played enough in the water,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Aunt Polly, when each child had told the story.
&#8220;Put on your shoes and stockings and see if you
can&#8217;t find me a maidenhair fern for my fern-box.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg found it first, and then Jud lent her his
jack-knife and showed her how to take it up so
that the roots would not be injured. Then he
left her for a minute while he went back to get
a paper cup from Linda to plant it in, and when
he came back he found her backed up against
a tree and looking frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;What scared you?&#8221; he asked quickly. &#8220;Did
you see a snake, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it
was. But it stared and stared at me, Jud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where did you see it?&#8221; demanded Jud
briskly. &#8220;Let me have a whack at it with this
branch. Where&#8217;d you see it, Meg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the hole in this tree,&#8221; answered Meg. &#8220;I
was shaking more dirt off the fern when I
looked up and there it was jiggling at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Jud again, a bit impatiently.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any hole.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m standing over it,&#8221; said Meg, &#8220;so the
thing can&#8217;t get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg, you see, was frightened, but not too
frightened to be interested and curious about a
strange animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s an animal, &#8217;cause it moves,&#8221; she
told Jud, as she stood aside to let him look in the
hole.</p>
<p>Jud put his hand in the hole&ndash;&ndash;it was an old
dead tree and hollow at the top&ndash;&ndash;and drew out
something soft and fluffy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as I thought,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
baby owl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how cunning,&#8221; cried Meg, coming closer
and venturing to put a finger on the bunch of
feathers. &#8220;But what a funny face, Jud!&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed the baby owl looked like a very young
and foolish monkey as it sat in Jud&#8217;s hands and
rolled its head and stared aimlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s pretty near blind,&#8221; Jud explained. &#8220;In
the daytime owls can hardly see at all. I suspect
there&#8217;s a nest in this old tree. Want to hold
it for me while I feel?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meg was certainly not afraid of a baby owl,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
and she took it tenderly. Sure enough, Jud
knew what he was talking about&ndash;&ndash;he put his arm
away into the tree trunk and brought out two
more little owls.</p>
<p>Twaddles and Dot had come up by this time,
and they were perfectly entranced with the
queer little birds.</p>
<p>Jud carefully put the baby owls back. Then
they planted the fern in the paper cup, found
Bobby, who was trying to fish with a breadcrumb
tied to a string, and told him about the
owls, and then they heard the wagon coming for
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a good time?&#8221; asked Peter, as he
helped them all in and the wagon started its
noisy trip home. Peter was eating one of the
sandwiches they had saved for him and looked
very contented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a nice time,&#8221; said the four little Blossoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there any mail?&#8221; asked Aunt Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just one letter,&#8221; replied Peter.</p>
<p>But that was a very important letter, as the
Blossoms found out when they were once more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
at home and Aunt Polly read it to them while
Linda was getting supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s coming!&#8221; cried Bobby, meeting
Jud on his way to the barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said Jud heartily. Then his
face fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t want to go home yet!&#8221; he
urged. &#8220;Vacation isn&#8217;t over so soon, is it?
There&#8217;s lots we planned to do we haven&#8217;t done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s going to stay a week,&#8221; said Bobby
happily. &#8220;School doesn&#8217;t open for two weeks,
but we have to go home and get ready. Say,
Jud, I didn&#8217;t miss Mother&ndash;&ndash;not such a lot, that
is&ndash;&ndash;but now I miss her dreadful much.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mother Blossom came she found all
the children in the car with Aunt Polly to meet
her. And the things they did during that one
week, from another picnic to having all the new
friends they had made at Brookside come to supper,
including Mr. Sparks&ndash;&ndash;well, Linda said
there was more going on than there had been all
through the summer, and Linda ought to have
known!</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pect Aunt Polly will miss us,&#8221; said Twaddles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
the last morning of their visit, as Mother
Blossom was buttoning Dot into a clean frock
and Aunt Polly was on her knees locking the
trunks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pect I shall,&#8221; said Aunt Polly, tears in
her kind eyes.</p>
<p>This was too much for Twaddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come and stay at our house,&#8221; he told her
earnestly. &#8220;And you can come and visit school.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the twins still insisted they were going to
school.</p>
<p>Aunt Polly promised that she would come to
see them some time during the winter and that
she wouldn&#8217;t cry any more but just remember
the nice times they had had together that summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you go to school, you&#8217;ll learn to write,
and then I shall look for letters,&#8221; she said seriously.</p>
<p>So the four little Blossoms started home for
Oak Hill and found a Daddy Blossom there very
glad to see them, as well as Norah and Sam and
Philip, who, as Meg observed, had &#8220;grown considerable.&#8221;
He wasn&#8217;t lame any more, either.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>And if you want to read about what Meg and
Bobby did in school, and how the twins contrived
to go to school, too, in spite of the fact
that they were only four years old, you must read
the next book about them which is called &#8220;Four
Little Blossoms at Oak Hill School.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s been a perfectly lovely summer,
hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Meg, while she was helping
unpack her things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best ever,&#8221; declared Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;And just think&ndash;&ndash;we own a cow!&#8221; cried Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;And maybe&ndash;&ndash;when she gets big&ndash;&ndash;we can
milk her,&#8221; added Twaddles. &#8220;Oh, I like the
country&ndash;&ndash;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all buy a farm when we grow up,&#8221; suggested
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s!&#8221; all the others cried in chorus.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em'>THE END</p>
